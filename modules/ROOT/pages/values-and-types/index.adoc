:description: This section provides an overview of data types in Cypher.


Cypher supports a range of data values. 
When writing Cypher queries, it is not possible to declare a data type. 
Rather, Cypher will automatically infer the data type of a given value.

More information about the data values and types supported by Cypher can be found in the following sections:
