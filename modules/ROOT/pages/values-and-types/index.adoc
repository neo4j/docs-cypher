= Values and types

Cypher supports a range of data types. 
When writing Cypher, it is not necessary to define the data type. 
Rather, the most appropriate data type will be automatically selected. 

////

- mention that data types can be returned using apoc.meta.cypher.type.
- mention that data types can be manually converted using various functions.
