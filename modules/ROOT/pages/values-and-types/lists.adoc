:description: Cypher has comprehensive support for lists.

[[cypher-lists]]
= Lists

Cypher includes comprehensive support for lists. 
This section first describes lists in general, and then discusses how to use list comprehension and pattern comprehension in lists. 

[NOTE]
====
Information regarding operators, such as list concatenation (`+`), element existence checking (`IN`), and access (`[]`) can be found xref::syntax/operators.adoc#query-operators-list[here].
The behavior of the `IN` and `[]` operators with respect to `null` is detailed xref::values-and-types/working-with-null.adoc[here].

[[cypher-lists-general]]
== Lists in general

A literal list is created by using brackets and separating the elements in the list with commas.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

A list can consist of different value types.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN [0, "hello", 3.14, null] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +[0, "hello", 3.14, null]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

Lists are indexed by 0 in Cypher.
To access individual elements in a list, use square brackets.
This extracts from the start index and up to, but not including, the end index.

For example:

.Query
[source, cypher]
---
WITH [5,1,7] AS list
RETURN list[2]
---

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list[2]+
| +7+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

=== List range and size 

The below examples use the xref::functions/list.adoc#functions-range[`range`] function to create lists.
This function returns a list containing all numbers between given start and end numbers.
The range is inclusive in both ends.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[3] AS element
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +element+
| +3+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

It is also possible to use negative numbers, to start from the end of the list instead.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[-3] AS element
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +element+
| +8+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

Finally, it is possible to use ranges inside the brackets to return ranges of the list.
The list range operator (`[]`) is inclusive of the first value, but exclusive of the last value. 

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[0..3] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +[0,1,2]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[0..-5] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +[0,1,2,3,4,5]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[-5..] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +[6,7,8,9,10]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[..4] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +[0,1,2,3]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

Out-of-bound slices are simply truncated, but out-of-bound single elements return `null`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[15] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +<null>+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN range(0, 10)[5..15] AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +[5,6,7,8,9,10]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

The xref::functions/scalar.adoc#functions-size[`size`] of a list can be obtained as follows:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN size(range(0, 10)[0..3]) AS list
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +list+
| +3+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===


[[cypher-pattern-comprehension]]
== Pattern comprehension

Pattern comprehension is a syntactic construct available in Cypher for creating a list based on matchings of a pattern.
A pattern comprehension matches the specified pattern like a normal `MATCH` clause, with predicates like a normal `WHERE` clause, but yields a custom projection as specified.

=== Example graph

The following graph is used for examples below:

image::values_and_types_lists_graph.svg[]

To recreate the graph, run the following query against an empty Neo4j database:

[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE
  (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'}),
  (johnnyMnemonic:Movie {title: 'Johnny Mnemonic', released: 1995}),
  (theMatrixRevolutions:Movie {title: 'The Matrix Revolutions', released: 2003}),
  (theMatrixReloaded:Movie {title: 'The Matrix Reloaded', released: 2003}),
  (theReplacements:Movie {title: 'The Replacements', released: 2000}),
  (theMatrix:Movie {title: 'The Matrix', released: 1999}),
  (theDevilsAdvocate:Movie {title: 'The Devils Advocate', released: 1997}),
  (theMatrixResurrections:Movie {title: 'The Matrix Resurrections', released: 2021}),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(johnnyMnemonic),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theMatrixRevolutions),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theMatrixReloaded),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theReplacements),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theMatrix),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theDevilsAdvocate),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theMatrixResurrections)
----

=== Examples

This example returns a list that contains the year when the movies were released.
The pattern matching in the pattern comprehension looks for `Matrix` in the movie title and that the node `keanu` (`Person` node with the name `Keanu Reeves`) has a relationship with the movie.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
RETURN [(keanu)-->(b:Movie) WHERE b.title CONTAINS 'Matrix' | b.released] AS years
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +years+
| +[2021,2003,2003,1999]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

The whole predicate, including the `WHERE` keyword, is optional and may be omitted.

==== Storing lists as properties 

It is possible to store homogenous lists of simple values as properties. 
For example, the following query creates a list from the `title` properties of the `Movie` nodes connected to `Keanu Reeves`. 
It then sets that list as a `resume` property on `Keanu Reeves`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
WITH keanu,[(keanu)-->(b:Movie) | b.title] AS movieTitles
SET keanu.resume = movieTitles
RETURN keanu.resume
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +keanu.resume+
| +["The Matrix Resurrections", "The Devils Advocate", "The Matrix", "The Replacements", "The Matrix Reloaded", "The Matrix Revolutions", "Johnny Mnemonic"]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

It is not, however, possible to store heterogeneous lists as properties.
For example, the following query, which tries to set a list including both the `title` and the `released` properties as the `resume` property of `Keanu Reeves` will fail. 
This is because the `title` property values are stored as strings, while the `released` property values are stored as integers. 

.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-fail]
----
MATCH (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
WITH keanu,[(keanu)-->(b:Movie) | b.title]  + [(keanu)-->(b:Movie) | b.released] AS movieTitles
SET keanu.resume = movieTitles
RETURN keanu.resume
----

[source,error]
----
Neo4j only supports a subset of Cypher types for storage as singleton or array properties. Please refer to section cypher/syntax/values of the manual for more details.
----


[[cypher-list-comprehension]]
== List comprehension

List comprehension is a syntactic construct available in Cypher for creating a list based on existing lists.

For example, the following query returns a new list from the previously created `resume` property (a list of strings) of `Keanu Reeves`:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (keanu:Person {name:'Keanu Reeves'})
RETURN [x IN keanu.resume WHERE x contains 'The Matrix'] AS matrixList
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +matrixList+
| +["The Matrix Resurrections", "The Matrix", "The Matrix Reloaded", "The Matrix Revolutions"]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

List comprehension follows the form of the mathematical set-builder notation (set comprehension) instead of the use of map and filter functions.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) WHERE x % 2 = 0 | x^3 ] AS result
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +result+
| +[0.0,8.0,64.0,216.0,512.0,1000.0]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

Either the `WHERE` part, or the expression, can be omitted, if you only want to filter or map respectively.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) WHERE x % 2 = 0 ] AS result
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +result+
| +[0,2,4,6,8,10]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) | x^3 ] AS result
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +result+
| +[0.0,1.0,8.0,27.0,64.0,125.0,216.0,343.0,512.0,729.0,1000.0]+
1+d|Rows: 1
|===
