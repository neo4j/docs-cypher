This section describes rules and recommendations for the naming of node labels, relationship types, property names, variables, indexes, and constraints.

== Naming rules

* Alphabetic characters:
** Names should begin with an alphabetic character.
** This includes "non-English" characters, such as `å`, `ä`, `ö`, `ü` etc.
* Numbers:
** Names should not begin with a number.
** To illustrate, `1first` is not allowed, whereas `first1` is allowed.
* Symbols:
** Names should not contain symbols, except for underscore, as in `my_variable`, or `$` as the first character to denote a xref::syntax/parameters.adoc[parameter], as given by `$myParam`.
* Length:
** Can be very long, up to `65535` (`2^16 - 1`) or `65534` characters, depending on the version of Neo4j.
* Case-sensitive:
** Names are case-sensitive and thus, `:PERSON`, `:Person` and `:person` are three different labels, and `n` and `N` are two different variables.
* Whitespace characters:
** Leading and trailing whitespace characters will be removed automatically.
For example, `MATCH (  a  ) RETURN a` is equivalent to `MATCH (a) RETURN a`.

=== Using special characters in names
Non-alphabetic characters, including numbers, symbols and whitespace characters, *can* be used in names, but *must* be escaped using backticks.
For example: `++`^n`++`, `++`1first`++`, `++`$$n`++`, and `++`my variable has spaces`++`.
Database names are an exception and may include dots without the need for escaping.
For example: naming a database `foo.bar.baz` is perfectly valid.

Within an escaped name, the following escaping sequences are allowed:

[options="header", cols=">1,<2"]
|===
|Escape sequence|Character
|````| Backtick
|`\uxxxx`| Unicode UTF-16 code point (4 hex digits must follow the `\u`)
|===

[NOTE]
====
Using escaped names with unsanitized user input makes you vulnerable to Cypher injection.
Some techniques to mitigate this are:

* sanitizing (and validating) the user input.
* remodeling your data model to avoid this data access pattern.

====

== Scoping and namespace rules

* Node labels, relationship types and property names may re-use names.
** The following query -- with `a` for the label, type and property name -- is valid: `+CREATE (a:a {a: 'a'})-[r:a]->(b:a {a: 'a'})+`.
* Variables for nodes and relationships must not re-use names within the same query scope.
** The following query is not valid as the node and relationship both have the name `a`: `+CREATE (a)-[a]->(b)+`.


== Recommendations

Here are the recommended naming conventions:

|===
| Node labels          | Camel-case, beginning with an upper-case character | `:VehicleOwner` rather than `:vehicle_owner` etc.
| Relationship types   | Upper-case, using underscore to separate words     | `:OWNS_VEHICLE` rather than `:ownsVehicle` etc.
