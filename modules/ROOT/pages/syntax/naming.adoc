= Naming rules and recommendations

This section describes rules and recommendations for the naming of node labels, relationship types, property names and xref:syntax/variables.adoc[variables].

== Naming rules

* Alphabetic characters:
** Names should begin with an alphabetic character.
** This includes "non-English" characters, such as `å`, `ä`, `ö`, `ü` etc.
* Numbers:
** Names should not begin with a number.
** To illustrate, `1first` is not allowed, whereas `first1` is allowed.
* Symbols:
** Names should not contain symbols, except for underscore, as in `my_variable`, or `$` as the first character to denote a xref:syntax/parameters.adoc[parameter], as given by `$myParam`.
* Length:
** Can be very long, up to `65535` (`2^16 - 1`) or `65534` characters, depending on the version of Neo4j.
* Case-sensitive:
** Names are case-sensitive and thus, `:PERSON`, `:Person` and `:person` are three different labels, and `n` and `N` are two different variables.
* Whitespace characters:
** Leading and trailing whitespace characters will be removed automatically.
For example, `MATCH (  a  ) RETURN a` is equivalent to `MATCH (a) RETURN a`.

[NOTE]
Non-alphabetic characters, including numbers, symbols and whitespace characters, *can* be used in names, but *must* be escaped using backticks.
For example: `++`^n`++`, `++`1first`++`, `++`$$n`++`, and `++`my variable has spaces`++`.

== Scoping and namespace rules

* Node labels, relationship types and property names may re-use names.
** The following query -- with `a` for the label, type and property name -- is valid: `CREATE (a:a {a: 'a'})-[r:a]->(b:a {a: 'a'})`.
* Variables for nodes and relationships must not re-use names within the same query scope.
** The following query is not valid as the node and relationship both have the name `a`: `CREATE (a)-[a]->(b)`.


== Recommendations

Here are the recommended naming conventions:

|===
| Node labels          | Camel-case, beginning with an upper-case character | `:VehicleOwner` rather than `:vehicle_owner` etc.
| Relationship types   | Upper-case, using underscore to separate words     | `:OWNS_VEHICLE` rather than `:ownsVehicle` etc.
|===
