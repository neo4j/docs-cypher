:description: This section describes how how to use comments in Cypher. 

A comment begin with double slash (`//`) and continue to the end of the line.
Comments do not execute, they are for humans to read.

Examples:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n //This is an end of line comment
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
//This is a whole line comment
RETURN n
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n) WHERE n.property = '//This is NOT a comment' RETURN n
----
