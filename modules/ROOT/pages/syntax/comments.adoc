This page describes how to use comments in Cypher.

A single line comment begins with double slash (`//`) and continues to the end of the line.
A multi-line comment begins with a slash and asterisk (`/&#42;`) and continues until the closing of the comment, which is done with an asterisk and a slash ('&#42;/'
)
Comments do not execute, they are for humans to read.

Examples:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n //This is an end of line comment
----

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n)
//This is a whole line comment
RETURN n
----

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n) /* This is a multi line comment,
the comment is still going on this line as well
but we are closing it on this line */
RETURN n
----

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n) WHERE n.property = '//This is NOT a comment' RETURN n
----
