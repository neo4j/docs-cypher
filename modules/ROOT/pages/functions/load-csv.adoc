= LOAD CSV functions

LOAD CSV functions can be used to get information about the file that is processed by the xref:clauses/load-csv.adoc[`LOAD CSV`] clause.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The functions described on this page are only useful when run on a query that uses `LOAD CSV`.
In all other contexts they will always return `null`.
