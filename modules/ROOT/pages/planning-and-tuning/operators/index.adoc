= Operators

This page provides an overview of the available operators in Cypher.
An operator is a specialized execution module that is responsible for some type of transformation to the data in a query execution plan before passing it on to the next operator, until the desired graph pattern has been matched.

For information about how to understand execution plans (and the role operators play in them), see xref:planning-and-tuning/execution-plans.adoc[].

For more information about each operator, see xref:planning-and-tuning/operators/operators-detail.adoc[].

== Summary of operators 

This table comprises all the execution plan operators ordered lexicographically.

* _Leaf_ operators, in most cases, locate the starting nodes and relationships required in order to execute the query.

* _Updating_ operators are used in queries that update the graph.

* _Eager_ operators xref::planning-and-tuning/execution-plans.adoc#lazy-eager-evaluation[accumulate all their rows] before piping them to the next operator.

[[operators-dbhits]]
== Database hits

Each operator will send a request to the storage engine to do work such as retrieving or updating data.
A _database hit_ (DBHits) is an abstract unit of this storage engine work.

These are all the actions that trigger one or more database hits:

* **Create actions**
** Create a node.
** Create a relationship.
** Create a new node label.
** Create a new relationship type.
** Create a new ID for property keys with the same name.

* **Delete actions**
** Delete a node.
** Delete a relationship.

* **Update actions**
** Set one or more labels on a node.
** Remove one or more labels from a node.

* **Node-specific actions**
** Get a node by its ID.
** Get the degree of a node.
** Determine whether a node is dense.
** Determine whether a label is set on a node.
** Get the labels of a node.
** Get a property of a node.
** Get an existing node label.
** Get the name of a label by its ID, or its ID by its name.

* **Relationship-specific actions**
** Get a relationship by its ID.
** Get a property of a relationship.
** Get an existing relationship type.
** Get a relationship type name by its ID, or its ID by its name.

* **General actions**
** Get the name of a property key by its ID, or its ID by the key name.
** Find a node or relationship through an index seek or index scan.
** Find a path in a variable-length expand.
** Find a shortest path.
** Ask the count store for a value.

* **Schema actions**
** Add an index.
