:description: Query tuning for the Cypher query language.
[[query-tuning]]
= Query tuning

Neo4j aims to execute queries as fast as possible.
However, when optimizing for maximum query execution performance, it may be helpful to rephrase queries using knowledge about the domain and the application.

This page contains information about how to tune queries using different strategies.

For information about changing the runtime of a query, see the page about xref:planning-and-tuning/runtimes/concepts.adoc[Cypher runtime concepts].

== General recommendations

The overall goal of manual query performance optimization is to ensure that only necessary data is retrieved from the graph.

Queries should aim to filter data as early as possible in order to reduce the amount of work that has to be done in the later stages of query execution.
This also applies to what gets returned: returning whole nodes and relationships ought to be avoided in favour of selecting and returning only the data that is needed.
You should also make sure to set an upper limit on variable length patterns, so they don't cover larger portions of the dataset than needed.

Each Cypher query gets optimized and transformed into an xref::planning-and-tuning/execution-plans.adoc[execution plan] by the Cypher query planner.
To minimize the resources used for this, try to use parameters instead of literals when possible.
This allows Cypher to re-use queries instead of having to parse and build new execution plans.

To read more about the execution plan operators mentioned in this section, see xref::planning-and-tuning/operators/index.adoc[].

== Query options 

Query execution can be fine-tuned through the use of query options.

In order to use one or more of these options, the query must be prepended with `CYPHER`, followed by the query option(s), as exemplified thus:

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
CYPHER query-option [further-query-options] query
----

For information about the various runtimes available in Cypher, see xref:planning-and-tuning/runtimes/index.adoc[].

[[cypher-planner]]
=== Cypher planner

The Cypher planner takes a Cypher query and computes an execution plan that solves it.
For any given query there is likely a number of execution plan candidates that each solve the query in a different way.
The planner uses a search algorithm to find the execution plan with the lowest estimated execution cost.

This table describes the available planner options:

[options="header",cols="2m,3a,^1a"]
|===
| Query option | Description | Default

| planner=cost
| Use cost based planning with default limits on plan search space and time.
| {check-mark}

| planner=idp
| Synonym for `planner=cost`.
|

| planner=dp
|
Use cost based planning without limits on plan search space and time to perform an exhaustive search for the best execution plan.

[NOTE]
====
Using this option can significantly _increase_ the planning time of the query.
====

|

|===


[[cypher-connect-components-planner]]
=== Cypher connect-components planner label:deprecated[]

One part of the Cypher planner is responsible for combining sub-plans for separate patterns into larger plans - a task referred to as _connecting components_.

This table describes the available query options for the connect-components planner:

[options="header",cols="2m,3a,^1a"]
|===
| Query option | Description | Default

| connectComponentsPlanner=greedy
|
Use a greedy approach when combining sub-plans.

[NOTE]
====
Using this option can significantly _reduce_ the planning time of the query.
====
|

| connectComponentsPlanner=idp
|
Use the cost based IDP search algorithm when combining sub-plans.

[NOTE]
====
Using this option can significantly _increase_ the planning time of the query but usually finds better plans.
====

| {check-mark}

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Cypher query option `connectComponentsPlanner` is deprecated and will be removed without a replacement.
The product's default behavior of using a cost-based IDP search algorithm when combining sub-plans will be kept.
====


[[cypher-update-strategy]]
=== Cypher update strategy
This option affects the eagerness of updating queries.

The possible values are:

[options="header",cols="2m,3a,^1a"]
|===
| Query option | Description | Default

| updateStrategy=default
| Update queries are executed eagerly when needed.
| {check-mark}

| updateStrategy=eager
| Update queries are always executed eagerly.
|

|===


[[cypher-expression-engine]]
=== Cypher expression engine

This option affects how the runtime evaluates expressions.

The possible values are:

[options="header",cols="2m,3a,^1a"]
|===
| Query option | Description | Default

| expressionEngine=default
| Compile expressions and use the compiled expression engine when needed.
| {check-mark}

| expressionEngine=interpreted
| Always use the _interpreted_ expression engine.
|

| expressionEngine=compiled
|
Always compile expressions and use the _compiled_ expression engine.

|

|===


[[cypher-operator-engine]]
=== Cypher operator engine

This query option affects whether the pipelined runtime attempts to generate compiled code for groups of operators.

The possible values are:

[options="header",cols="2m,3a,^1a"]
|===
| Query option | Description | Default

| operatorEngine=default
| Attempt to generate compiled operators when applicable.
| {check-mark}

| operatorEngine=interpreted
| Never attempt to generate compiled operators.
|

| operatorEngine=compiled
|
Always attempt to generate _compiled_ operators.

Cannot be used together with `runtime=slotted`.

|

|===


[[cypher-interpreted-pipes-fallback]]
=== Cypher interpreted pipes fallback

This query option affects how the pipelined runtime behaves for operators it does not directly support.

The available options are:

[options="header",cols="2m,3a,^1a"]
|===
| Query option | Description | Default

| interpretedPipesFallback=default
| Equivalent to `interpretedPipesFallback=whitelisted_plans_only`.
| {check-mark}

| interpretedPipesFallback=disabled
|
If the plan contains any operators not supported by the pipelined runtime then another runtime is chosen to execute the entire plan.

Cannot be used together with `runtime=slotted`.

|

| interpretedPipesFallback=whitelisted_plans_only
|
Parts of the execution plan can be executed on another runtime.
Only certain operators are allowed to execute on another runtime.

Cannot be used together with `runtime=slotted`.

|

| interpretedPipesFallback=all
|
Parts of the execution plan may be executed on another runtime.
Any operator is allowed to execute on another runtime.
Queries with this option set might produce incorrect results, or fail.

Cannot be used together with or `runtime=slotted`.

[WARNING]
====
This setting is experimental, and using it in a production environment is discouraged.

[[cypher-replanning]]
=== Cypher replanning

Cypher replanning occurs in the following circumstances:

* When the query is not in the cache.
This can either be when the server is first started or restarted, if the cache has recently been cleared, or if link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/configuration-settings#config_server.db.query_cache_size[server.db.query_cache_size] was exceeded.
* When the time has past the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/configuration-settings#config_dbms.cypher.min_replan_interval[dbms.cypher.min_replan_interval] value, and the database statistics have changed more than the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/configuration-settings#config_dbms.cypher.statistics_divergence_threshold[dbms.cypher.statistics_divergence_threshold] value.

There may be situations where xref::planning-and-tuning/execution-plans.adoc[Cypher query planning] can occur at a non-ideal time.
For example, when a query must be as fast as possible and a valid plan is already in place.

[NOTE]
====
Replanning is not performed for all queries at once; it is performed in the same thread as running the query, and can block the query.
However, replanning one query does not replan any other queries.
====

There are three different replan options available:

[options="header",cols="2m,3a,^1a"]
|===
| Option | Description | Default

| replan=default
| This is the planning and replanning option as described above.
| {check-mark}

| replan=force
| This will force a replan, even if the plan is valid according to the planning rules.
Once the new plan is complete, it replaces the existing one in the query cache.
|

| replan=skip
| If a valid plan already exists, it will be used even if the planning rules would normally dictate that it should be replanned.
|

|===

The replan option is prepended to queries.

For example:

[source, syntax]
----
CYPHER replan=force MATCH ...
----

In a mixed workload, you can force replanning by using the Cypher `EXPLAIN` commands.
This can be useful to schedule replanning of queries which are expensive to plan, at known times of low load.
Using `EXPLAIN` will make sure the query is only planned, but not executed.

For example:

[source, syntax]
----
CYPHER replan=force EXPLAIN MATCH ...
----

During times of known high load, `replan=skip` can be useful to not introduce unwanted latency spikes.
