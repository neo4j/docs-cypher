[[existential]]
= EXISTS subqueries

An `EXISTS` subquery can be used to find out if a specified pattern exists at least once in the graph.
It serves the same purpose as a xref::clauses/where.adoc#filter-on-patterns[path pattern] but it is more powerful because it allows you to use `MATCH` and `WHERE` clauses internally.
Moreover, it can appear in any expression position, unlike path patterns.
If the `EXISTS` subquery evaluates to at least one row, the whole expression will become `true`.
This also means that the system only needs to evaluate if there is at least one row and can skip the rest of the work.

Any non-writing query is allowed.
`EXISTS` subqueries differ from regular queries in that the final `RETURN` clause may be omitted,
as any variable defined within the subquery will not be available outside of the expression, even if a final `RETURN` clause is used.

It is worth noting that the `MATCH` keyword can be omitted in subqueries in cases where the `EXISTS` consists of only a pattern and an optional `WHERE` clause.

== Example graph

The following graph is used for the examples below:

To recreate the graph, run the following query against an empty Neo4j database:

[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE
(andy:Swedish:Person {name: 'Andy', age: 36}),
(timothy:Person {name: 'Timothy', nickname: 'Tim', age: 25}),
(peter:Person {name: 'Peter', nickname: 'Pete', age: 35}),
(andy)-[:HAS_DOG {since: 2016}]->(:Dog {name:'Andy'}),
(timothy)-[:HAS_CAT {since: 2019}]->(:Cat {name:'Mittens'}),
(fido:Dog {name:'Fido'})<-[:HAS_DOG {since: 2010}]-(peter)-[:HAS_DOG {since: 2018}]->(:Dog {name:'Ozzy'}),
(fido)-[:HAS_TOY]->(:Toy{name:'Banana'})
----

[[existential-simple]]
== Simple `EXISTS` subquery

Variables introduced by the outside scope can be used in the `EXISTS` subquery without importing them.
In this regard, `EXISTS` subqueries are different from `CALL` subqueries, xref::subqueries/call-subquery.adoc#call-importing-variables[which do require importing].
The following example shows this:


[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
WHERE EXISTS {
    (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(:Dog)
}
RETURN person.name AS name
----

[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Andy"
| "Peter"
1+d|Rows: 2
|===

[[existential-where]]
== `EXISTS` subquery with `WHERE` clause

A `WHERE` clause can be used in conjunction to the `MATCH`.
Variables introduced by the `MATCH` clause and the outside scope can be used in this scope.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
WHERE EXISTS {
  MATCH (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(dog:Dog)
  WHERE person.name = dog.name
}
RETURN person.name AS name
----

[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Andy"
1+d|Rows: 1
|===


[[existential-nesting]]
== Nesting `EXISTS` subqueries

`EXISTS` subqueries can be nested like the following example shows.
The nesting also affects the scopes.
That means that it is possible to access all variables from inside the subquery which are either from the outside scope or defined in the very same subquery.


[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
WHERE EXISTS {
  MATCH (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(dog:Dog)
  WHERE EXISTS {
    MATCH (dog)-[:HAS_TOY]->(toy:Toy)
    WHERE toy.name = 'Banana'
  }
}
RETURN person.name AS name
----

[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Peter"
1+d|Rows: 1
|===

[[existential-outside-where]]
== `EXISTS` subquery outside of a `WHERE` clause

`EXISTS` subquery expressions can appear anywhere that an expression is valid.
Here the result is a boolean that shows whether the subquery can find the given pattern.


[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
RETURN person.name AS name, EXISTS {
  MATCH (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(:Dog)
} AS hasDog
----

[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| name | hasDog
| "Andy" | true
| "Timothy" | false
| "Peter" | true
2+d|Rows: 3
|===


[[existential-union]]
== `EXISTS` subquery with a `UNION`

_This feature was introduced in Neo4j 5.3._

`Exists` can be used with a `UNION` clause, and the `RETURN` clauses are not required.
It is worth noting that if one branch has a `RETURN` clause, then all branches require one.
The below example demonstrates that if one of the `UNION` branches was to return at least one row, the entire `EXISTS` expression will evaluate to true.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
RETURN
    person.name AS name,
    EXISTS {
        MATCH (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(:Dog)
        UNION
        MATCH (person)-[:HAS_CAT]->(:Cat)
    } AS hasPet
----

[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| name        | hasPet
| "Andy"      | true
| "Timothy"   | true
| "Peter"     | true
2+d|Rows: 3
|===


[[existential-with]]
== `EXISTS` subquery with `WITH`

_This feature was introduced in Neo4j 5.3._

Variables from the outside scope are visible for the entire subquery, even when using a `WITH` clause.
To avoid confusion, shadowing of these variables is not allowed.
An outside scope variable is shadowed when a newly introduced variable within the inner scope is defined with the same variable.
In the example below, the outer variable `name` is shadowed and will therefore throw an error.

[source, cypher, role=test-fail]
----
WITH 'Peter' as name
MATCH (person:Person {name: name})
WHERE EXISTS {
    WITH "Ozzy" AS name
    MATCH (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(d:Dog)
    WHERE d.name = name
}
RETURN person.name AS name
----

.Error message
[source, output, role="noheader"]
----
The variable `name` is shadowing a variable with the same name from the outer scope and needs to be renamed (line 4, column 20 (offset: 90))
----

New variables can be introduced into the subquery, as long as they use a different identifier.
In the example below, a `WITH` clause introduces a new variable.
Note that the outer scope variable `person` referenced in the main query is still available after the `WITH` clause.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
WHERE EXISTS {
    WITH "Ozzy" AS dogName
    MATCH (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(d:Dog)
    WHERE d.name = dogName
}
RETURN person.name AS name
----

[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Peter"
1+d|Rows: 1
|===


[[existential-return]]
== `EXISTS` subquery with `RETURN`

_This feature was introduced in Neo4j 5.3._

`EXISTS` subqueries do not require a `RETURN` clause at the end of the subquery. If one is present, it does not
need to be aliased, which is different compared to xref::subqueries/call-subquery.adoc[`CALL` subqueries].
Any variables returned in an `EXISTS` subquery will not be available after the subquery.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
WHERE EXISTS {
    MATCH (person)-[:HAS_DOG]->(:Dog)
    RETURN person.name
}
RETURN person.name AS name
----

[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Andy"
| "Peter"
1+d|Rows: 2
|===
