= Subqueries

A Cypher subquery is called from an enclosing outer query, and executes within its own scope, as defined by `{` and `}`.
A subquery can appear anywhere in a query that an expression is valid.

There are restrictions on how subqueries interact with the enclosing query:

* A subquery can only refer to variables from the enclosing query if they are explicitly imported.
* A subquery cannot return variables with the same names as variables in the enclosing query.
* All variables that are returned from a subquery are afterwards available in the enclosing query.
