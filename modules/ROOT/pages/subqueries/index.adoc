= Subqueries

A Cypher subquery is called from an enclosing outer query, and executes within its own scope, as defined by `{` and `}`.
Any variable that is defined in the outside scope can be referenced inside the subquery's own scope.
However, variables introduced inside the subquery are not part of the outside scope and therefore cannot be accessed outside of the subquery.

Cypher includes four different types of subqueries:

* xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc[]
* xref:subqueries/existential.adoc[EXISTS subqueries]
* xref:subqueries/count.adoc[COUNT subqueries]
* xref:subqueries/collect.adoc[COLLECT subqueries] label:new[Introduced in 5.6]
