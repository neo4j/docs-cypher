= Subqueries

A Cypher subquery is called from an enclosing outer query, and executes within its own scope, as defined by `{` and `}`.
Subqueries can appear anywhere in a query that an expression is valid.
Any variable that is defined in the outside scope can be referenced inside the subqueryâ€™s own scope. Variables introduced inside the subquery are not part of the outside scope and therefore cannot be accessed on the outside.
