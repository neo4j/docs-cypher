= CALL subqueries
:description: This page describes how to use Cypher's `CALL` subquery.

The `CALL` clause can be used to invoke subqueries that execute operations within a defined scope, thereby optimizing data handling and query efficiency. 
Unlike other subqueries in Cypher, `CALL` subqueries can be used to perform changes to the database (e.g. xref:clauses/create.adoc[] new nodes).

[NOTE]
The `CALL` clause is also used for calling procedures.
For descriptions of the `CALL` clause in this context, refer to the xref::clauses/call.adoc[`CALL` procedure].

[[call-example-graph]]
== Example graph

A graph with the following schema is used for the examples below:

image::call_subquery_graph.svg[]

To recreate the graph, run the following query in an empty Neo4j database:

[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE (teamA:Team {name: 'Team A'}),
       (teamB:Team {name: 'Team B'}),
       (teamC:Team {name: 'Team C'}),
       (playerA:Player {name: 'Player A', age: 21}),
       (playerB:Player {name: 'Player B', age: 23}),
       (playerC:Player {name: 'Player C', age: 19}),
       (playerD:Player {name: 'Player D', age: 30}),
       (playerE:Player {name: 'Player E', age: 25}),
       (playerF:Player {name: 'Player F', age: 35}),
       (playerA)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(teamA),
       (playerB)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(teamA),
       (playerD)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(teamB),
       (playerE)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(teamC),
       (playerF)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(teamC),
       (teamA)-[:OWES {dollars: 1500}]->(teamB),
       (teamA)-[:OWES {dollars: 3000}]->(teamB),
       (teamB)-[:OWES {dollars: 1700}]->(teamC),
       (teamC)-[:OWES {dollars: 5000}]->(teamB)

== Semantics and performance

A `CALL` subquery is executed once for each incoming row.
The variables returned in a subquery are available to the outer scope of the enclosing query.

.Basic example
====
In this example, the `CALL` subquery executes three times, one for each row that the xref:clauses/unwind.adoc[`UNWIND`] clause outputs.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND [0, 1, 2] AS x
CALL () {
  RETURN 'hello' AS innerReturn
}
RETURN innerReturn
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="m"]
|===
| innerReturn

| 'hello'
| 'hello'
| 'hello'

d|Rows: 3
|===
====

Each execution of a `CALL` subquery can observe changes from previous executions.
This allows for the accumulation of results and the progressive transformation of data within a single Cypher query.

.Incremental updates 
====
In this example, each iteration of the `CALL` subquery adds 1 to the `age` of `Player A` and the returned `newAge` reflects the `age` after each increment.

.Incrementally update the age property of a Player
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND [1, 2, 3] AS x
CALL () {
    MATCH (p:Player {name: 'Player A'})
    SET p.age = p.age + 1
    RETURN p.age AS newAge
}
MATCH (p:Player {name: 'Player A'})
RETURN x AS iteration, newAge, p.age AS totalAge
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols=""3*<m"]
|===

| iteration | newAge | totalAge

| 1 | 22 | 24

| 2 | 23 | 24

| 3 | 24 | 24

3+d|Rows: 3
|===
====

The scoping effect of a `CALL` subquery means that the work performed during each execution of each row can be cleaned up as soon its execution ends, before proceeding to the next row.
This allows for efficient resource management and reduces memory overhead by ensuring that temporary data structures created during the subquery execution do not persist beyond their usefulness.
As a result, `CALL` subqueries can help maintain optimal performance and scalability, especially in complex or large-scale queries.

.Performance
====
In this example, a `CALL` subquery is used to xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-collect[`collect`] a `LIST` containing all players who play for a particular team.

.Collect a list of all players playing for a particular team
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Team)
CALL (t) {
  MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(t)
  RETURN collect(p) as players
}
RETURN t AS team, players
----

.Result
[source, role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="m,2m"]
|===
| team
| players

| (:Team {name: "Team A"})
| (:Player {name: "Player B", age: 23}), (:Player {name: "Player A", age: 24})]

| (:Team {name: "Team B"})
| [(:Player {name: "Player D", age: 30})]

| (:Team {name: "Team C"})
| [(:Player {name: "Player F", age: 35}), (:Player {name: "Player E", age: 25})]

2+d|Rows: 3
|===

The `CALL` subquery ensures that each `Team` is processed separately (one row per `Team` node), rather than having to hold every `Team` and `Player` node in heap memory simultaneously before collecting them into lists.
Using a `CALL` subquery can therefore reduce the amount of heap memory required for an operation.
====

[[import-variables]]
== Importing variables

Variables from the outer scope must be explicitly imported into the inner scope of the `CALL` subquery, either by using a xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc#variable-scope-clause[variable scope clause] or an xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc#importing-with[importing `WITH` clause] (deprecated).
As the subquery is evaluated for each incoming input row, the imported variables are assigned the corresponding values from that row.

[role=label--new-5.23]
[[variable-scope-clause]]
=== The variable scope clause

Variables can be imported into a `CALL` subquery using a scope clause: `CALL (<variable>)`.
Using the scope clause disables the deprecated xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc#importing-with[importing `WITH`] clause.

A scope clause can be used to import all, specific, or none of the variables from the outer scope.

.Import specific variables from the outer scope
====

This example only imports the `p` variable from the outer scope and uses it to create a new, randomly generated, `rating` property for each `Player` node.
It then returns the `Player` node with the highest `rating`.

.Import one variable from the outer scope
[source, cypher, role=test-result-skip]
----
MATCH (p:Player), (t:Team)
CALL (p) {
  WITH rand() AS random
  SET p.rating = random
  RETURN p.name AS playerName, p.rating AS rating
}
RETURN playerName, rating, t AS team
ORDER BY rating
LIMIT 1
----

.Result
[source, role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="3*m"]
|===
| playerName
| rating
| team

| "Player C"
| 0.9307432039870395
| "Team A"

3+d|Rows: 1

|===

To import additional variables, include them within the parentheses after `CALL`, separated by commas.
For example, to import both variables from the `MATCH` clause in the above query, modify the scope clause accordingly: `CALL (p, t)`.
====

.Import all variables 
====
To import all variables from the outer scope, use `CALL (*)`.
This example imports both the `p` and `t` variables and sets a new `lastUpdated` property on both.

.Import all variables from the outer scope
[source, cypher, role=test-result-skip]
----
MATCH (p:Player), (t:Team)
CALL (*) {
  SET p.lastUpdated = timestamp()
  SET t.lastUpdated = timestamp()
}
RETURN p.name AS playerName,
       p.lastUpdated AS playerUpdated,
       t.name AS teamName,
       t.lastUpdated AS teamUpdated
LIMIT 1
----

.Result
[source, role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="4*m"]
|===

| playerUpdated
| teamName

To import no variables from the outer scope, use `CALL ()`.

[[variable-scope-rules]]
==== Rules

* The scope clause’s variables can be globally referenced in the subquery.
A subsequent `WITH` within the subquery cannot delist an imported variable.
The deprecated xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc#importing-with[importing `WITH` clause] behaves differently because imported variables can only be referenced from the first line and can be delisted by subsequent clauses.

* Variables cannot be aliased in the scope clause.
Only simple variable references are allowed.

.Not allowed
[source,cypher,role=test-fail]
----
MATCH (t:Team)
CALL (t AS teams) {
  MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(teams)
  RETURN collect(p) as players
}
RETURN t AS teams, players
----

* The scope clause’s variables cannot be re-declared in the subquery.

.Not allowed
[source,cypher,role=test-fail]
----
MATCH (t:Team)
CALL (t) {
  WITH 'New team' AS t
  MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(t)
  RETURN collect(p) as players
}
RETURN t AS team, players
----

* The subquery cannot return a variable name which already exists in the outer scope.
To return imported variables they must be renamed.

.Not allowed
[source,cypher,role=test-fail]
----
MATCH (t:Team)
CALL (t) {
  RETURN t
}
RETURN t
----

[role=label--deprecated]
[[importing-with]]
=== Importing `WITH` clause

Variables can also be imported into a `CALL` subquery using an importing `WITH` clause.
Note that this syntax is not xref:appendix/gql-conformance/index.adoc[GQL conformant].

.Variables imported by `WITH` clause
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Team)
CALL { 
  WITH t
  MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(t)
  RETURN collect(p) as players
}
RETURN t AS teams, players
----

.Click to read more about importing variables using the `WITH` clause
[%collapsible]
====

* Just as when using a variable scope clause, a subquery using an importing `WITH` clause cannot return a variable name which already exists in the outer scope.
To return imported variables they must be renamed.

* The importing `WITH` clause must the first clause of a subquery (or the second clause, if directly following a `USE` clause).
* It is not possible to follow an importing `WITH` clause with any of the following clauses: `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, `SKIP`, and `LIMIT`.

Attempting any of the above, will throw an error.
For example, the following query using a `WHERE` clause after an importing `WITH` clause will throw an error:

.Not Allowed
[source, cypher, role=test-fail]
----
UNWIND [[1,2],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4,5]] AS l
CALL {
  WITH l
  WHERE size(l) > 2
  RETURN l AS largeLists
}
RETURN largeLists
----

.Error message
[source, error]
----
Importing WITH should consist only of simple references to outside variables.
WHERE is not allowed.
----

A solution to this restriction, necessary for any filtering or ordering of an importing `WITH` clause, is to declare a second `WITH` clause after the importing `WITH` clause.
This second `WITH` clause will act as a regular `WITH` clause.
For example, the following query will not throw an error:

.Allowed
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND [[1,2],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4,5]] AS l
CALL {
  WITH l
	WITH l

  RETURN l AS largeLists
}
RETURN largeLists

[[optional-call]]
== Optional subquery calls

`OPTIONAL CALL` allows for optional execution of a `CALL` subquery.
Similar to xref:clauses/optional-match.adoc[`OPTIONAL MATCH`] any empty rows produced by the `OPTIONAL CALL` subquery will return `null`.

.Difference between using `CALL` and `OPTIONAL CALL`
====

This example, which finds the team that each `Player` plays for, highlights the difference between using `CALL` and `OPTIONAL CALL`.

.Regular subquery `CALL`
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Player)
CALL (p) {
    MATCH (p)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(team:Team)
    RETURN team
}
RETURN p.name AS playerName, team.name AS team
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*m"]
|===
| playerName | team

| "Player A" | "Team A"
| "Player B" | "Team A"
| "Player D" | "Team B"
| "Player E" | "Team C"
| "Player F" | "Team C" 

2+d|Rows: 5
|===

Note that no results are returned for `Player C`, since they are not connected to any `Team` with a `PLAYS_FOR` relationship.

.Query using regular `OPTIONAL CALL`
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Player)
OPTIONAL CALL (p) {
    MATCH (p)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(team:Team)
    RETURN team
}
RETURN p.name AS playerName, team.name AS team
----

Now all `Player` nodes, regardless of whether they have any `PLAYS_FOR` relationships connected to a `Team`, are returned.

[[call-execution-order]]
== Execution order of CALL subqueries

The order in which rows from the outer scope are passed into subqueries is not defined.
If the results of the subquery depend on the order of these rows, use an `ORDER BY` clause before the `CALL` clause to guarantee a specific processing order for the rows.

.Ordering results before `CALL` subquery
====
This example creates a linked list of all `Player` nodes in order of ascending `age`.

The `CALL` clause is relying on the incoming row ordering to ensure that a correctly ordered linked list is created, thus the incoming rows must be ordered with a preceding `ORDER BY` clause.

.Order results before a `CALL` subquery

[[call-post-union]]
== Post-union processing

Call subqueries can be used to further process the results of a xref:clauses/union.adoc[] query.

.Using `UNION` within a `CALL` subquery
====
This example query finds the youngest and the oldest `Player` in the graph.

.Find the oldest and youngest players

If different parts of a result should be matched differently, with some aggregation over the whole result, subqueries need to be used.
The example below query uses a `CALL` subquery in combination with `UNION ALL` to determine how much each `Team` in the graph owes or is owed.

.Find how much every team is owed

[[call-aggregation]]
== Aggregations

Returning subqueries change the number of results of the query.
The result of the `CALL` subquery is the combined result of evaluating the subquery for each input row.

.`CALL` subquery changing returned rows of outer query
====
The following example finds the name of each `Player` and the team they play for.
No rows are returned for `Player C`, since they are not connected to a `Team` with a `PLAYS_FOR` relationship.
The number of results of the subquery thus changed the number of results of the enclosing query.

.Find the friends of players

.`CALL` subqueries and isolated aggregations
====

Subqueries can also perform isolated aggregations.
The below example uses the xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-sum[sum()] function to count how much money is owed between the `Team` nodes in the graph.
Note that the `owedAmount` for `Team A` is the aggregated results of two `OWES` relationships to `Team B`.

[[call-returning-unit]]
== Note on returning subqueries and unit subqueries

The examples above have all used subqueries which end with a `RETURN` clause.
These subqueries are called _returning subqueries_.

A subquery is evaluated for each incoming input row.
Every output row of a returning subquery is combined with the input row to build the result of the subquery.
That means that a returning subquery will influence the number of rows.
If the subquery does not return any rows, there will be no rows available after the subquery.

Subqueries without a `RETURN` statement are called _unit subqueries_.
Unit subqueries are used for their ability to alter the graph with clauses such as `CREATE`, `MERGE`, `SET`, and `DELETE`.
They do not explicitly return anything, and this means that the number of rows present after the subquery is the same as was going into the subquery.

[[call-unit-subqueries]]
== Unit subqueries

Unit subqueries are used for their ability to alter the graph with updating clauses.
They do not impact the amount of rows returned by the enclosing query.

This example query creates 3 clones of each existing `Player` node in the graph.
As the subquery is a unit subquery, it does not change the number of rows of the enclosing query.

.Create cloned nodes

[[call-rules]]
== Summary

* `CALL` subqueries optimize data handling and query efficiency, and can perform changes to the database.

* `CALL` subqueries allow for row-by-row data transformation and enable the accumulation of results across multiple rows, facilitating complex operations that depend on intermediate or aggregated data.

* `CALL` subqueries can only refer to variables from the enclosing query if they are explicitly imported by either a variable scope clause or an importing `WITH` clause (deprecated).

* All variables that are returned from a `CALL` subquery are afterwards available in the enclosing query.

* Returning subqueries (with `RETURN` clause) influence the number of output rows, while unit subqueries (without `RETURN` clause) perform graph updates without changing the number of rows.

* An `ORDER BY` clause can be used before `CALL` subqueries to ensure a specific order.

* `CALL` subqueries can be used in combination with `UNION` to process and aggregate different parts of a query result.
