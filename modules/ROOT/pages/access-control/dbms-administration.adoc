:description: This section explains how to use Cypher to manage Neo4j DBMS administrative privileges. 

All DBMS privileges are relevant system-wide.
Like user management, they do not belong to one specific database or graph.
For more details on the differences between graphs, databases and the DBMS, refer to xref:introduction/neo4j-databases-graphs.adoc[].

image::grant-privileges-dbms.png[title="Syntax of GRANT and DENY DBMS Privileges"]

image::privilege-hierarchy-dbms.png[title="DBMS privileges hierarchy"]

The xref:access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-admin[`admin` role] has a number of built-in privileges.
These include:

* Create and drop databases.
* Change configuration parameters.
* Manage transactions.
* Manage users and roles.
* Manage sub-graph privileges.
* Manage procedure security.

The easiest way to enable a user to perform these tasks is to grant them the `admin` role.
All of these privileges are also assignable using Cypher commands.
See the sections on xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-role-management[role management],
xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-user-management[user management],

xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-execute[procedure and user defined function security] for details.
It is possible to make a custom role with a subset of these privileges.


[[access-control-dbms-administration-custom]]
== Using a custom role to manage DBMS privileges

If it is desired to have an administrator with a subset of privileges that includes all DBMS privileges, but not all database privileges, this can be achieved in multiple ways.
One way is to copy the `admin` role and revoking or denying the unwanted privileges.
A second option is to build a custom administrator from scratch by granting the wanted privileges instead.

As an example, let's create an administrator that can only manage users and roles by using the latter option.

. First we create the new role:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE ROLE usermanager
----
. Then we grant the privilege to manage users:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT USER MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO usermanager
----
. And to manage roles:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ROLE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO usermanager
----

The resulting role has privileges that only allow user and role management:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE usermanager PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

Lists all privileges for role `usermanager`:

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT ROLE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `usermanager`"
|"GRANT USER MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `usermanager`"
a|Rows: 2
|===

However, this role doesn't allow all DBMS capabilities.
For example, the role is missing privilege management, creating and dropping databases as well as executing admin procedures.
We can make a more powerful administrator by granting a different set of privileges.
Let's create an administrator that can perform almost all DBMS capabilities, excluding database management, but also with some limited database capabilities, such as managing transactions:

. Again, we start by creating a new role:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE ROLE customAdministrator
----
. Then we grant the privilege for all DBMS capabilities:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ALL DBMS PRIVILEGES ON DBMS TO customAdministrator
----
. And explicitly deny the privilege to manage databases:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY DATABASE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO customAdministrator
----
. Thereafter we grant the transaction management privilege:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT (*) ON DATABASE * TO customAdministrator
----

The resulting role has privileges that allow all DBMS privileges except creating and dropping databases, as well as managing transactions:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE customAdministrator PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

Lists all privileges for role `customAdministrator`:

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"DENY DATABASE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `customAdministrator`"
|"GRANT ALL DBMS PRIVILEGES ON DBMS TO `customAdministrator`"
|"GRANT TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT (*) ON DATABASE * TO `customAdministrator`"

If we want to allow executing all but a few procedures, we can grant `EXECUTE PROCEDURES *` and deny the unwanted procedures.
For example, the following queries allow for executing all procedures, except those starting with `dbms.killTransaction`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO deniedProcedureExecutor
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY EXECUTE PROCEDURE dbms.killTransaction* ON DBMS TO deniedProcedureExecutor
----

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing all procedures except those starting with `dbms.killTransaction`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE deniedProcedureExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

Lists all privileges for role `deniedProcedureExecutor`:

The `dbms.killTransaction` and `dbms.killTransactions` are blocked, as well as any other procedures starting with `dbms.killTransaction`.


[[access-control-execute-boosted-procedure]]
=== The `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege

The ability to execute a procedure with elevated privileges can be granted via the `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege.
A user with this privilege is allowed to execute the procedures matched by the xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing] without the execution being restricted to their other privileges.
There is no need to grant an individual `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` privilege for the procedures either, as granting the `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` includes an implicit `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` grant for them.
A denied `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` still denies executing the procedure.
The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.labels, db.relationshipTypes ON DBMS TO boostedProcedureExecutor
----

Users with the role `boostedProcedureExecutor` can then run `db.labels` and `db.relationshipTypes` with full privileges, seeing everything in the graph not just the labels and types that the user has `TRAVERSE` privilege on.

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing procedures `db.labels` and `db.relationshipTypes`, but with elevated execution:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE boostedProcedureExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

Lists all privileges for role `boostedProcedureExecutor`:

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.labels ON DBMS TO `boostedProcedureExecutor`"
|"GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.relationshipTypes ON DBMS TO `boostedProcedureExecutor`"
a|Rows: 2
|===

Granting `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` on its own allows the procedure to be both executed (because of the implicit `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` grant) and given elevated privileges during the execution.
A denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` on its own behaves slightly differently, and only denies the elevation and not the execution of the procedure.
However, a role with only a granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` and a denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` will deny the execution as well.
This is explained through the following examples:

.Grant `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` and deny `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE`
[example]
====
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO deniedBoostedProcedureExecutor1
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.labels ON DBMS TO deniedBoostedProcedureExecutor1
----

The resulting role has privileges that allow executing all procedures using the user's own privileges, as well as blocking `db.labels` from being elevated.
The deny `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` does not block execution of `db.labels`.

.How would the privileges from Examples 1 to 4 affect the output of a procedure?
[example]
====
Let's assume there exists a procedure called `myProc`.

This procedure gives the result `A` and `B` for a user with `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` privilege and `A`, `B` and `C` for a user with `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege.

Now, let's adapt the privileges in examples 1 to 4 to apply to this procedure and show what is returned.
With the privileges from example 1, granted `EXECUTE PROCEDURE *` and denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`, the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A` and `B`.

With the privileges from example 2, granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE *` and denied `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc`, execution of the `myProc` procedure is not allowed.

With the privileges from example 3, granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE *` and denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`, execution of the `myProc` procedure is not allowed.

With the privileges from example 4, granted `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc` and `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE *` and denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`, the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A` and `B`.

For comparison, when only granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`, the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A`, `B` and `C`, without needing to be granted the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc` privilege.
====


[[access-control-admin-procedure]]
=== The `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURE` privilege

The ability to execute admin procedures (annotated with `@Admin`) can be granted via the `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES` privilege.
This privilege is equivalent with granting the xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-execute-boosted-procedure[`EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege] on each of the admin procedures.
Any new admin procedures that gets added are automatically included in this privilege.
The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES ON DBMS TO adminProcedureExecutor
----

Users with the role `adminProcedureExecutor` can then run any admin procedure with elevated privileges.

The resulting role has privileges that allow executing all admin procedures:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE adminProcedureExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

Lists all privileges for role `adminProcedureExecutor`:

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES ON DBMS TO `adminProcedureExecutor`"
a|Rows: 1
|===

To compare this with the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` and `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privileges, let's revisit the `myProc` procedure.
This time as an admin procedure, which gives the result `A`, `B` and `C` when allowed to execute.

Let's start with a user only granted the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc` privilege, execution of the `myProc` procedure is not allowed.

However, for a user granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc` or `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES`, the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A`, `B` and `C`.

Any denied execute privilege results in the procedure not being allowed to execute.
It does not matter whether `EXECUTE PROCEDURE`, `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` or `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES` is denied.


[[access-control-execute-user-defined-function]]
=== The `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege

//EXECUTE [USER [DEFINED]] FUNCTION[S]
The ability to execute a user defined function (UDF) can be granted via the `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege.
A user with this privilege is allowed to execute the UDFs matched by the xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege does not apply to built-in functions, which are always executable.
====

.Execute user defined function
======
The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION apoc.coll.* ON DBMS TO functionExecutor
----

Or in short form:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTION apoc.coll.* ON DBMS TO functionExecutor
----

Users with the role `functionExecutor` can then run any UDF in the `apoc.coll` namespace.
The function is run using the user's own privileges.

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing UDFs in the `apoc.coll` namespace:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE functionExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

Lists all privileges for role `functionExecutor`:

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTION apoc.coll.* ON DBMS TO `functionExecutor`"
a|Rows: 1
|===
======

If you want to allow executing all but a few UDFs, you can grant `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS *` and deny the unwanted functions.

.Execute user defined functions
======
The following queries allow for executing all UDFs except those starting with `apoc.any.prop`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS * ON DBMS TO deniedFunctionExecutor
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION apoc.any.prop* ON DBMS TO deniedFunctionExecutor

Or in short form:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTIONS * ON DBMS TO deniedFunctionExecutor
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY EXECUTE FUNCTION apoc.any.prop* ON DBMS TO deniedFunctionExecutor
----

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing all procedures except those starting with `apoc.any.prop`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE deniedFunctionExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS

[[access-control-execute-boosted-user-defined-function]]
=== The `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege

//EXECUTE BOOSTED [USER [DEFINED]] FUNCTION[S]
The ability to execute a user defined function (UDF) with elevated privileges can be granted via the `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege.
A user with this privilege is allowed to execute the UDFs matched by the xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing] without the execution being restricted to their other privileges.
There is no need to grant an individual `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege for the functions either, as granting the `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` includes an implicit `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` grant for them.
A denied `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` still denies executing the function.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege does not apply to built-in functions, as they have no concept of elevated privileges.
====

Granting `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` on its own allows the UDF to be both executed (because of the implicit `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` grant) and given elevated privileges during the execution.
A denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` on its own behaves slightly differently, and only denies the elevation and not the execution of the UDF.
However, a role with only a granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` and a denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` denies the execution as well.
This is the same behavior as for the xref:access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-execute-boosted-procedure[`EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege].

.Execute boosted user defined function
======
The following query shows an example of how to grant the `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION apoc.any.properties ON DBMS TO boostedFunctionExecutor
----

Or in short form:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED FUNCTION apoc.any.properties ON DBMS TO boostedFunctionExecutor
----

Users with the role `boostedFunctionExecutor` can then run `apoc.any.properties` with full privileges, seeing every property on the node/relationship not just the properties that the user has `READ` privilege on.

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing the UDF `apoc.any.properties`, but with elevated execution:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----

[[access-control-name-globbing]]
=== Procedure and user-defined function name-globbing

The name-globbing for procedure and user defined function names is a simplified version of globbing for filename expansions, only allowing two wildcard characters; `+*+` and `?`.
They are used for multiple and single character matches, where `+*+` means 0 or more characters and `?` matches exactly one character.

[NOTE]
====
The name-globbing is subject to the xref:syntax/naming.adoc[standard Cypher restrictions on valid identifiers],
with the exception that it may include dots, stars, and question marks without the need for escaping using backticks.
Each part of the name-globbing separated by dots may be individually escaped, for example, `++mine.`procedureWith%`++` but not `++mine.procedure`With%`++`.
Also good to keep in mind is that the wildcard characters behave as wildcards even when escaped.
As an example, using `++`*`++` is equivalent to using `+*+`, and thus allows executing all functions or procedures and not only the procedure or function named `+*+`.
====

The examples below only use procedures but the same rules apply to user defined function names.
For the examples below, assume we have the following procedures:

* `mine.public.exampleProcedure`
* `mine.public.exampleProcedure1`
* `mine.public.exampleProcedure2`
* `mine.public.with#Special§Characters`
* `mine.private.exampleProcedure`
* `mine.private.exampleProcedure1`
* `mine.private.exampleProcedure2`
* `mine.private.with#Special§Characters`
* `your.exampleProcedure`

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO globbing1
----

Users with the role `globbing1` can then run procedures all the procedures.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE mine.*.exampleProcedure ON DBMS TO globbing2
----

Users with the role `globbing2` can then run procedures `mine.public.exampleProcedure` and `mine.private.exampleProcedure`, but none of the others.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE mine.*.exampleProcedure? ON DBMS TO globbing3
----

Users with the role `globbing3` can then run procedures `mine.public.exampleProcedure1`, `mine.private.exampleProcedure1` and `mine.private.exampleProcedure2`, but none of the others.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE *.exampleProcedure ON DBMS TO globbing4
----

Users with the role `globbing4` can then run procedures `your.exampleProcedure`, `mine.public.exampleProcedure` and `mine.private.exampleProcedure`, but none of the others.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE mine.public.exampleProcedure* ON DBMS TO globbing5
----

Users with the role `globbing5` can then run procedures `mine.public.exampleProcedure`, `mine.public.exampleProcedure1` and `mine.public.exampleProcedure42`, but none of the others.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE `mine.public.with#*§Characters`, mine.private.`with#Spec???§Characters` ON DBMS TO globbing6
----

Users with the role `globbing6` can then run procedures `mine.public.with#Special§Characters` and `mine.private.with#Special§Characters`, but none of the others.

[NOTE]
====
The name-globbing may be fully or partially escaped, and both the `+*+` and `+?+` are interpreted as wildcards either way.
