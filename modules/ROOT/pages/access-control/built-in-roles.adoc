--
This section explains the default privileges of the built-in roles in Neo4j and how to recreate them if needed.
--

All of the commands described in this chapter require that the user executing the commands has the rights to do so.
The privileges listed in the following sections are the default set of privileges for each built-in role:

* xref::access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-public[The `PUBLIC` role]
* xref::access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-reader[The `reader` role]
* xref::access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-editor[The `editor` role]
* xref::access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-publisher[The `publisher` role]
* xref::access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-architect[The `architect` role]
* xref::access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-admin[The `admin` role]

[[access-control-built-in-roles-public]]
== The `PUBLIC` role

All users are granted the `PUBLIC` role, and it can not be revoked or dropped.
By default, it gives access to the default database and allows executing all procedures and user-defined functions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `PUBLIC` role cannot be dropped or revoked from any user, but the specific privileges for the role can be modified.
In contrast to the `PUBLIC` role, the other built-in roles can be granted, revoked, dropped, and re-created.

=== Listing `PUBLIC` role privileges

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE PUBLIC PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]

[[access-control-built-in-roles-public-recreate]]
=== Recreating the `PUBLIC` role

The `PUBLIC` role can not be dropped and thus there is no need to recreate the role itself.
To restore the role to its original capabilities, two steps are needed.

First, all `GRANT` or `DENY` privileges on this role should be revoked (see output of `SHOW ROLE PUBLIC PRIVILEGES AS REVOKE COMMANDS` on what to revoke).
Secondly, run these queries:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ACCESS ON HOME DATABASE TO PUBLIC
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURES * ON DBMS TO PUBLIC
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS * ON DBMS TO PUBLIC
----

The resulting `PUBLIC` role now has the same privileges as the original built-in `PUBLIC` role.


[[access-control-built-in-roles-reader]]
== The `reader` role

The `reader` role can perform read-only queries on all graphs except for the `system` database.

|"GRANT SHOW INDEX ON DATABASE * TO `reader`"
a|Rows: 5
|===


[[access-control-built-in-roles-reader-recreate]]
=== Recreating the `reader` role

To restore the role to its original capabilities two steps are needed.
First, execute `DROP ROLE reader`.
Secondly, run these queries:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]

----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ACCESS ON DATABASE * TO reader
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]

----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----

The resulting `reader` role now has the same privileges as the original built-in `reader` role.


[[access-control-built-in-roles-editor]]
== The `editor` role

The `editor` role can perform read and write operations on all graphs except for the `system` database, but it cannot create new labels, property keys or relationship types.

[[access-control-built-in-roles-admin]]
== The `admin` role

The `admin` role can do the same as the xref::access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-architect[`architect`], as well as manage databases, aliases, users, roles and privileges.

The `admin` role has the ability to perform administrative tasks.
These include the rights to perform the following classes of tasks:

* Manage xref::access-control/database-administration.adoc[database security] to control the rights to perform actions on specific databases:
** Manage access to a database and the right to start and stop a database.
** Manage xref::indexes-for-search-performance.adoc[indexes] and xref::constraints/index.adoc[constraints].
** Allow the creation of labels, relationship types or property names.
** Manage transactions
* Manage xref::access-control/dbms-administration.adoc[DBMS security] to control the rights to perform actions on the entire system:
** Manage xref::databases.adoc[multiple databases].
** Manage xref::access-control/manage-users.adoc[users] and xref::access-control/manage-roles.adoc[roles].
** Change configuration parameters.
** Manage sub-graph privileges.
** Manage procedure security.

These rights are conferred using privileges that can be managed through the xref::access-control/manage-privileges.adoc#access-control-graph-privileges[`GRANT`, `DENY` and `REVOKE` commands].

If the built-in `admin` role has been altered or dropped, and needs to be restored to its original state, see xref:5.0@operations-manual:ROOT:configuration/password-and-user-recovery/index.adoc[Operations Manual -> Password and user recovery].


[[access-control-built-in-roles-admin-recreate]]
