:description: this page describes the three fundamental concepts of a Cypher query: nodes, relationships, and patterns.

Fundamentally, a Neo4j graph database consists of three core entities: nodes, relationships, and paths.
Cypher queries are constructed to either match or create these entities in a graph.
Having a basic understanding of what nodes, relationships, and paths are in a graph database is therefore crucial in order to construct Cypher queries.

The below examples use the xref:clauses/match.adoc[] and xref:clauses/return.adoc[] clauses to find and return the desired graph patterns.
To learn more about these and many other Cypher clauses, see the section on xref:clauses/index.adoc[].

[[core-concepts-nodes]]
== Nodes

The data entities in a Neo4j graph database are called nodes.
Nodes are referred to in Cypher using parenthesis `()`.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person {name:'Anna'})
RETURN n.born AS birthYear
----

In the above example, the node includes the following:

* A `Person` *label*.
Labels are like tags, and are used to query the database for specific nodes.
A node may have multiple labels, for example `Person` and `Actor`.
* A `name` *property* set to `Anna`.
Properties are defined within curly braces, `{}`, and are used to provide nodes with specific information, which can also be queried for and further improve the ability to pinpoint data.
* A *variable*, `n`.
Variables allow referencing specified nodes in subsequent clauses.

In this example, the first `MATCH` clause finds all `Person` nodes in the graph with the `name` property set to `Anna`, and binds them to the variable `n`.
The variable `n` is then passed along to the subsequent `RETURN` clause, which returns the value of a different property (`born`) belonging to the same node.

[[core-concepts-relationships]]
== Relationships

Nodes in a graph can be connected with relationships.
A relationship must have a start node, an end node, and exactly one type.
Relationships are represented in Cypher with arrows (e.g. `+-->+`) indicating the direction of a relationship.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Anna'})-[r:KNOWS WHERE r.since < 2020]->(friend:Person)
RETURN count(r) As numberOfFriends
----

Unlike nodes, information within a relationship pattern must be enclosed by square brackets.
The query example above matches for relationships of type `KNOWS` and with the property `since` set to less than `2020`.
The query also requires the relationships to go from a `Person` node named `Anna` to any other `Person` nodes, referred to as `friend`.
The xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-count[count()] function is used in the `RETURN` clause to count all the relationships bound by the `r` variable in the preceding `MATCH` clause (i.e. how many friends `Anna` has known since before `2020`).

Note that while nodes can have several labels, relationships can only have one type.

[[core-concepts-paths]]
== Paths

Paths in a graph consist of connected nodes and relationships.
Exploring these paths sits at the very core of Cypher.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Anna'})-[:KNOWS]-{1,5}(friend:Person WHERE n.born < friend.born)
RETURN DISTINCT friend.name AS olderConnections
----

This example uses a xref:patterns/variable-length-patterns.adoc#quantified-relationships[quantified relationship] to find all paths up to `5` hops away, traversing only relationships of type `KNOWS` from the start node `Anna` to other older `Person` nodes (as defined by the xref:clauses/where.adoc[] clause).
The xref:syntax/operators.adoc#syntax-using-the-distinct-operator[DISTINCT] operator is used to ensure that the `RETURN` clause only returns unique nodes.

Paths can also be assigned variables.
For example, the below query binds a whole path pattern, which matches the xref:patterns/reference.adoc#shortest-functions[shortest path] from `Anna` to another `Person` node in the graph up to `10` hops away with the `nationality` property set to `Canadian`.
In this case, the `RETURN` clause returns the full path between the two nodes.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p=shortestPath((:Person {name: 'Anna'})-[:KNOWS*1..10]-(:Person {nationality: 'Canadian'}))
RETURN p
----
