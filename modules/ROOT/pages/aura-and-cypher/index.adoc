== Using Cypher on Aura

Most Cypher features are available on all tiers of Aura. 
There are, however, some features which are not available on any Aura instance.
For example, it is not possible to create, alter, or drop databases using Aura, nor is it possible to alter or drop servers.

There are also certain Cypher features which are only available on AuraDB Enterprise.
These can be categorized as the role-based access-control features of Cypher. 
For example, it is not possible to create, alter, or drop roles using AuraDB Free, AuraDB Pro, AuraDS Pro, or AuraDS Enterprise, but it is possible using AuraDB Enterprise. 

The Cypher Manual uses two different labels to differentiate this distinction:

[role=not-on-aura]
[options="header,cols=""2a,2a"]
|===
| Label | Description
| label:not-on-aura[] | Cypher feature not available on any tier of Aura.
| label:aura-db-enterprise[] | Cypher feature only available on AuraDB Enterprise.
