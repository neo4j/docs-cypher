= Using search performance indexes

Include:

- when to index
- over-indexing
- when not to index
- indexes in query plans
- deciding what indexes to use (
When you write a Cypher query, you do not need to specify which indexes to use. Cypherâ€™s query planner decides which of the available indexes to use.
