= Indexes

An index is a copy of specified primary data in a Neo4j database, such as nodes, relationships, or properties.
The data stored in the index provides an access path to the data in the primary storage and allows users to evaluate query filters more efficiently (and, in some cases, semantically interpret query filters).
In short, much like indexes in a book, their function in a Neo4j graph database is to make data retrieval more efficient. 

Once an index has been created, it will be automatically populated and updated by the DBMS. 

Neo4j supports two categories of indexes: xref:indexes/search-performance-index-overview.adoc[] and xref:indexes/semantic-index-overview.adoc[].

== Naming rules and best practices

The following is true for naming indexes:

* Best practice is to give the index a name when it is created.
If the index is not explicitly named, it gets an auto-generated name.
* The index name must be unique among both indexes and xref:constraints/index.adoc[constraints].
* Index creation is by default not idempotent, and an error will be thrown if you attempt to create the same index twice.
Using the keyword `IF NOT EXISTS` makes the command idempotent, and no error will be thrown if you attempt to create the same index twice.
