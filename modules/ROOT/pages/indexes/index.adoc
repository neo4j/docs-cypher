= Indexes

A database index is a copy of specified data in a database, such as nodes, relationships, or properties.
Much like indexes in a book, their function is to make the retrieval of data more efficient.
The creation and maintenance of indexes doe, however, come at the cost of additional storage space and slower writes, so deciding what to index and what not to index is an important and often non-trivial task.

Once an index has been created, it will be managed and kept up to date by the DBMS.
Neo4j will automatically start using the index once it has been created and brought online.

The following index types are supported by Neo4j:

* xref:indexes/indexes-for-search-performance.adoc[] - this includes range, point, text, and token lookup indexes.
* xref:indexes/indexes-for-full-text-search.adoc[]
* xref:indexes/indexes-for-vector-search.adoc[]

For information on index configuration and limitations, refer to the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/performance/index-configuration[Operations Manual -> Index configuration].

== Naming rules and best practices

The following is true for indexes:

* Best practice is to give the index a name when it is created.
If the index is not explicitly named, it gets an auto-generated name.
* The index name must be unique among both indexes and xref:constraints/index.adoc[constraints].
* Index creation is by default not idempotent, and an error will be thrown if you attempt to create the same index twice.
Using the keyword `IF NOT EXISTS` makes the command idempotent, and no error will be thrown if you attempt to create the same index twice.
