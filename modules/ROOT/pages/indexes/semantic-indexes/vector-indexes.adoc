[[indexes-vector]]
= Vector search index

_Vector search indexes were released as a public beta in Neo4j 5.11 and general availability in Neo4j 5.13._

Vector indexes allow users to query vector embeddings from large datasets.
An embedding is a numerical representation of a data object, such as text, image, audio, or document.

For example, each word or token in a text is typically represented as high-dimensional vector where each dimension represents a certain aspect of the wordâ€™s meaning.
Words that are semantically similar or related are often represented by vectors that are closer to each other in this vector space.
This allows for mathematical operations like addition and subtraction to carry semantic meaning.
For example, the vector representation of "king" minus "man" plus "woman" might be close to the vector representation of "queen."
In other words, vector embeddings can be said to be a numerical representation of a particular data object, capturing its semantic meaning.

The embedding for a particular data object can be generated by, for example, the https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai[Vertex AI] or https://openai.com/[OpenAI] embedding generators, which can produce vector embeddings with dimensions such as 768, 1024, and 1536.
These vector embeddings are stored as `LIST<FLOAT>` properties on a node, where each dimensional component of the vector is an element in the `LIST`.
A Neo4j vector index can be used to index nodes by `LIST<FLOAT>` properties valid to the index.

In Neo4j, a vector index allows you to write queries that match a _neighborhood_ of nodes based on the similarity between the properties of those nodes and the ones specified in the query.

Neo4j vector indexes are powered by the link:https://lucene.apache.org/[Apache Lucene] indexing and search library.
Lucene implements a Hierarchical Navigable Small World{fn-hnsw} (HNSW) Graph to perform a _k_ approximate nearest neighbors (_k_-ANN) query over the vector fields.

== Vector index commands and procedures

Vector indexes are managed through Cypher commands and built-in procedures, see {link-procedures-reference}[Operations Manual -> Procedures] for a complete reference.

The procedures and commands for vector indexes are listed in the following table:

[[indexes-vector-create]]
== Create and configure vector indexes

You can create vector indexes using the `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` command.
An index can be given a unique name when created (or get a generated one), which is used to reference the specific index when xref:#indexes-vector-query[querying] or xref:indexes-vector-drop[dropping] it.

Creating a vector index requires link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/database-administration/#access-control-database-administration-index[the `CREATE INDEX` privilege].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The index name must be unique among both indexes and constraints.
====

A vector index is a single-label, single-property index for nodes.
A vector index needs to be configured with both the dimensionality of the vector (`INTEGER` between `1` and `2048` _inclusive_), and the measure of similarity between two vectors (case-insensitive `STRING`).
For details, see xref:#indexes-vector-similarity[].

[NOTE]
====
More details about the syntax descriptions can be found link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/database-administration/syntax/#administration-syntax-reading[here].
====

.Syntax for creating vector indexes
[options="header", width="100%", cols="5a, 3"]
|===
| Command | Description

| [source, syntax, role=noplay, indent=0]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX [index_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
ON (n.propertyName)
OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"
----
| Create a vector index on nodes.
The options map is mandatory because setting the vector dimensions and similarity function is mandatory when creating a vector index.

|===

It is considered best practice to give the index a name when it is created.
This name is needed for both dropping and querying the index.
If the index is not explicitly named, it will get an auto-generated name.
As of Neo4j 5.16, the index name can also be given as a parameter, `CREATE VECTOR INDEX $name FOR ...`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The index name must be unique among all indexes and constraints.
====

The `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` command take an `OPTIONS` clause. This has two parts, the `indexProvider` and `indexConfig`.
The provider can only have the default value, `'vector-1.0'`.
The `indexConfig` is a `MAP` from `STRING` values to `STRING` and `INTEGER` values, and is used to set the index-specific configuration settings (the vector dimensions and similarity function).

The command is optionally idempotent. This means that its default behavior is to throw an error if an attempt is made to create the same index twice.
With `IF NOT EXISTS`, no error is thrown and nothing happens should an index with the same name, schema or both already exist.
It may still throw an error should a constraint with the same name exist.

[NOTE]
====
The new index is not immediately available but is created in the background.
====

All vectors within the index must have the same dimensionality.
The measure of similarity is determined by the given vector similarity function.
This defines how similar two vectors are to one another by a similarity score, how vectors are interpreted, and what vectors are valid for the index.

A node is indexed if all the following are true:

* The node contains the configured label.
* The node contains the configured property key.
* The respective property value is of type `LIST<FLOAT>`.
* The xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-size[`size()`] of the respective value is the same as the configured dimensionality.
* The value is a valid vector for the configured similarity function.

Otherwise, a node is not indexed.

.Create a vector index
====

For instance, assume you have a graph of research papers, and each paper has an abstract.
You want to find papers in the neighborhood of a paper you know.

.Data model
[source,syntax,role="noheader",indent=0]
----
(:Title)<--(:Paper)-->(:Abstract)
----

Assume for each abstract, you have generated a 1536-dimensional vector `embedding` of the abstract's `text` using Open AI's default model, `text-embedding-ada-002`.
This model suggests a xref:indexes-vector-similarity-cosine[cosine similarity].
For more information, see link:https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use[OpenAI's official documentation].

You can create a cosine vector index over the `embedding` property.

.Query
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX `abstract-embeddings`
FOR (n: Abstract) ON (n.embedding)
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
 `vector.dimensions`: 1536,
 `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}}
----

You can see that the vector index has been created using `SHOW INDEXES`:

[[indexes-vector-query]]
== Query a vector index

You can query a vector index using the procedure {link-procedures-reference}#procedure_db_index_vector_queryNodes[`db.index.vector.queryNodes`].

.Signature for `db.index.vector.queryNodes` to query a vector index
[source,syntax,role="noheader",indent=0]
----
db.index.vector.queryNodes(indexName :: STRING, numberOfNearestNeighbours :: INTEGER, query :: LIST<FLOAT>) :: (node :: NODE, score :: FLOAT)
----

* The `indexName` (a `STRING`) refers to the unique name of the vector index to query.
* The `numberOfNearestNeighbours` (an `INTEGER`) refers to the number of nearest neighbors to return as the neighborhood.
* The `query` vector (a `LIST<FLOAT>`) in which to search for the neighborhood.

The procedure returns the neighborhood of nodes with their respective similarity scores, ordered by those scores.
The scores are bounded between `0` and `1`, where the closer to `1` the score is, the more similar the indexed vector is to the query vector.

.Query a vector index
====
This example takes the paper that describes the HNSW{fn-hnsw} graph structure that the vector index implements and tries to find similar papers.
First you `MATCH` to find the paper, and then you query the `abstract-embeddings` index for a neighborhood of `10` similar abstracts to your query.
Finally, you `MATCH` for the neighborhood's respective titles.

.Query
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (title:Title)<--(:Paper)-->(abstract:Abstract)
WHERE toLower(title.text) = 'efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using
  hierarchical navigable small world graphs'

CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('abstract-embeddings', 10, abstract.embedding)
YIELD node AS similarAbstract, score

MATCH (similarAbstract)<--(:Paper)-->(similarTitle:Title)
RETURN similarTitle.text AS title, score
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="5m,2m"]

|===

The results are expected, with papers discussing graph-based nearest-neighbor searches.

The most similar to this result is the query vector itself, which is to be expected as the index was queried with an indexed property.
If the query vector itself is not wanted, you can use `WHERE score < 1` to remove equivalent vectors to the query vector.

====

[[indexes-vector-drop]]
== Drop vector indexes

A vector index is dropped by using the xref:indexes/search-performance-indexes/managing-indexes.adoc#drop-an-index[same command as for other indexes], `DROP INDEX`.

Dropping a vector index requires link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/database-administration/#access-control-database-administration-index[the `DROP INDEX` privilege].

Dropping a vector index requires link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/database-administration/#access-control-database-administration-index[the `DROP INDEX` privilege].

[role=beta]
[[indexes-vector-set]]
== Set a vector property on a node

Valid vectors for use in the index must have components finitely representable in {ieee-754} _single_ precision.
They are represented as properties on nodes with the type `LIST<FLOAT>`.
As of Neo4j 5.13, you can set a vector property using the {link-procedures-reference}#procedure_db_create_setNodeVectorProperty[`db.create.setNodeVectorProperty`] procedure.
It validates the input and sets the property as an array of {ieee-754} single precision values.
This beta procedure replaces {link-procedures-reference}#procedure_db_create_setVectorProperty[`db.create.setVectorProperty`].

.Signature for `db.create.setNodeVectorProperty`
[source,syntax]
----
db.create.setNodeVectorProperty(node :: NODE, key :: STRING, vector :: LIST<FLOAT>)
----

.Signature for `db.create.setVectorProperty` label:deprecated[]
[source,syntax]
----
db.create.setVectorProperty(node :: NODE, key :: STRING, vector :: LIST<FLOAT>) :: (node :: NODE)
----

The following example shows how to define embeddings as Cypher parameters by matching a node and setting its vector properties using `db.create.setNodeVectorProperty`:

.Set a vector via `db.create.setVectorProperty`
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Node {id: $id})
CALL db.create.setNodeVectorProperty(n, 'propertyKey', $vector)
RETURN node
----

Furthermore, you can also use a list parameter containing several `MATCH` criteria and embeddings to update multiple nodes in an `UNWIND` clause.
This is ideal for creating and setting new vector properties in the graph.

You can also set a vector property on a node using the xref:clauses/set.adoc#set-set-a-property[`SET`] command as in the following example:

.Set a vector property via `SET`
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (node:Node {id: $id})
SET node.propertyKey = $vector
RETURN node
----

However, Cypher stores the provided `LIST<FLOAT>` as a primitive array of {ieee-754} _double_ precision values. 
This takes up almost twice as much space compared to the alternative method, where you use the `db.create.setNodeVectorProperty` procedure.
As a result, using `SET` for a vector index is not recommended. 

To reduce the storage space, you can reset the existing properties using `db.create.setNodeVectorProperty`. 
However, this comes with the cost of an increase in the transaction log size until they are rotated away.

[[indexes-vector-similarity]]
== Supported similarity functions

The choice of similarity function affects which indexed vectors are considered similar, and which are valid.
The semantic meaning of the vector may itself dictate which similarity function to choose.
Refer to the documentation for the particular vector embedding model you are using, as it may suggest a preference for certain similarity functions.
Otherwise, being able to differentiate between the various similarity functions can assist in making a more informed decision.

.Similarity functions
[%header,cols="d,m,e"]
|===
| Name | Case insensitive argument | Key similarity feature

| xref:#indexes-vector-similarity-euclidean[Euclidean]
| "euclidean"
| distance

| xref:indexes-vector-similarity-cosine[Cosine]
| "cosine"
| angle

|===

For {l2-norm}alized vectors (unit vectors), thus having unit length image:l2norm_is_1.svg["The l2-norm of vector v equals 1"], Euclidean and cosine similarity functions produce the same similarity ordering.

[[indexes-vector-similarity-euclidean]]
=== Euclidean similarity

Euclidean similarity is useful when the _distance_ between the vectors is what determines how similar two vectors are.

A valid vector for a Euclidean vector index is when all vector components can be represented finitely in {ieee-754} single precision.

Euclidean interprets the vectors in Cartesian coordinates.
The measure is related to the Euclidean distance, i.e., how far two points are from one another.
However, that distance is unbounded and less useful as a similarity score.
Euclidean similarity bounds the square of the Euclidean distance.

image::euclidean_similarity_equation.svg["The Euclidean of vector v and vector u is defined as 1 over the quantity 1 plus the square of the l2-norm of vector v subtract vector u, which exists in the bounded set of real numbers between 0 exclusive and 1 inclusive."]

[[indexes-vector-similarity-cosine]]
=== Cosine similarity

Cosine similarity is used when the _angle_ between the vectors is what determines how similar two vectors are.

A valid vector for a cosine vector index is when:

* All vector components can be represented finitely in {ieee-754} single precision.
* Its {l2-norm} is non-zero and can be represented finitely in {ieee-754} single precision.

Cosine similarity interprets the vectors in Cartesian coordinates.
The measure is related to the angle between the two vectors.
However, an angle can be described in many units, sign conventions, and periods.
The trigonometric cosine of this angle is both agnostic to the aforementioned angle conventions and bounded.
Cosine similarity rebounds the trigonometric cosine.

image::cosine_similarity_equation.svg["The cosine of vector v and vector u is defined as half of the quanity 1 plus the scalar product of v hat u hat, which equals half of the quantity 1 plus the scalar product of vector v vector u over the product of the l2-norm of vector v and the l2 norm ov vector u, which exists in the bounded set of real numbers between 0 inclusive and 1 inclusive."]
In the above equation the trigonometric cosine is given by the scalar product of the two unit vectors.

[[indexes-vector-limitations]]
== Limitations and idiosyncrasies

* The query is an _approximate_ nearest neighbor search.
The requested _k_ nearest neighbors may not be the exact _k_ nearest, but close within the same wider neighborhood, such as finding a local extremum _vs_ the true extremum.

* For large requested nearest neighbors, _k_, close to the total number of indexed vectors, the search may retrieve fewer than _k_ results.

* The index must have a unique name.
There is no provided method for an autogenerated name.

* Only one vector index can be over a schema.
For example, you cannot have one xref:indexes-vector-similarity-euclidean[Euclidean] and one xref:indexes-vector-similarity-cosine[cosine] vector index on the same label-property key pair.

* Only node vector indexes are supported.

* No provided settings or options for tuning the index.

* Changes made within the same transaction are not visible to the index.

| Vector index queries throw an exception if the transaction state contains changes. This means that writes may only take place *after* the last vector index query in a transaction.

[TIP]
====
To work around this issue if you need to run multiple vector index queries and make changes based on the results, you can run the queries in a `+CALL { ... } IN TRANSACTIONS+` clause to isolate them from the outer transaction's state.

d| The validation for xref:indexes-vector-similarity-cosine[cosine similarity] verifies that the vector's {l2-norm} can be represented finitely in {ieee-754} *double* precision, rather than in _single_ precision.

| Neo4j 5.12

| {link-procedures-reference}#procedure_db_index_vector_queryNodes[`db.index.vector.queryNodes`] query vector validation is incorrect with a xref:indexes-vector-similarity-cosine[cosine] vector index. The {l2-norm} validation only considers the last component of the vector. If that component is `&plusmn;0.0`, an otherwise valid query vector will be thrown as invalid. This can also result in some invalid vectors being used to query, and return a similarity score of `&plusmn;0.0`.

[TIP]
====
For {l2-norm}alized vectors (unit vectors), thus having unit length image:l2norm_is_1.svg["The l2-norm of vector v equals 1"], Euclidean and cosine similarity functions produce the same similarity ordering.
