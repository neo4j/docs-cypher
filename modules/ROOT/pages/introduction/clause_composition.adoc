This section describes the semantics of Cypher when composing different read and write clauses.
--

A query is made up from several clauses chained together.
These are discussed in more detail in the chapter on xref::clauses/index.adoc[Clauses].

The semantics of a whole query is defined by the semantics of its clauses.
Each clause has as input the state of the graph and a table of intermediate results consisting of the current variables.
The output of a clause is a new state of the graph and a new table of intermediate results, serving as input to the next clause.
The first clause takes as input the state of the graph before the query and an empty table of intermediate results.
The output of the last clause is  the result of the query.

.Table of intermediate results between read clauses
======

Let's use a simple example graph with the following content:

[graphviz]
----
digraph L { node [shape=record style=rounded];
  N0 [
    label = "{Person|name = \'John\'\l}"
  ]
  N0 -> N3 [
    color = "#2e3436"
    fontcolor = "#2e3436"
    label = "FRIEND\n"
  ]
  N0 -> N1 [
    color = "#2e3436"
    fontcolor = "#2e3436"
    label = "FRIEND\n"
  ]
  N1 [
    label = "{Person|name = \'Joe\'\l}"
  ]
  N1 -> N2 [
    color = "#2e3436"
    fontcolor = "#2e3436"
    label = "FRIEND\n"
  ]
  N2 [
    label = "{Person|name = \'Steve\'\l}"
  ]
  N3 [
    label = "{Person|name = \'Sara\'\l}"
  ]
  N3 -> N4 [
    color = "#2e3436"
    fontcolor = "#2e3436"
    label = "FRIEND\n"
  ]
  N4 [
    label = "{Person|name = \'Maria\'\l}"
  ]
}
----

And let's see the table of intermediate results after each clause of the following query:

[source,cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (john {name: 'John'})
MATCH (john)-[:FRIEND]->(friend)
RETURN friend.name AS friendName
----

The query only has read clauses, so the state of the graph remains unchanged and is therefore omitted below.

Above we simplified by only looking at clauses that allow linear composition and omitting write clauses.
Let's explore these topics in the next sections.

[[cypher-clause-composition-rw-queries]]
== Read-write queries

In a query read and write clauses can take turn.
The important difference to read-only queries is that the state of the graph also changes inbetween clauses.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A clause can never observe writes made by a later clause.

.Table of intermediate results and state of the graph between read and write clauses
======

Let's use the same example graph as above.
And let's see the table of intermediate results and the state of the graph after each clause of the following query:

[source,cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (j) WHERE j.name STARTS WITH "J"
CREATE (j)-[:FRIEND]->(jj:Person {name: "Jay-jay"})
----
The query finds all nodes where the `name` property starts with "J"
and for each such node it creates another node with  the `name` property set to "Jay-jay".

It is important to note that the `MATCH` clause does not find the `Person` nodes that are created by the `CREATE` clause,
even though the name "Jay-jay" starts with "J".
This is because the `CREATE` clause comes after the `MATCH` clause and thus the `MATCH` can not observe any changes to
the graph made by the `CREATE`.

======

[[cypher-clause-composition-union-queries]]
== Queries with `UNION`

xref::clauses/union.adoc[`UNION`] queries are slightly different because the results of two or more queries are put together,
but each query starts with an empty table of intermediate results.

In a query with a UNION any clause _before_ the `UNION` cannot observe writes made by a clause _after_ the `UNION`.
Any clause _after_ `UNION` can observe all writes made by a clause _before_ the `UNION`.
That means that the rule that a clause can never observe writes made by a later clause still applies in queries using `UNION`.

It is important to note that the `MATCH` clause finds the `Person` node that is created by the `CREATE` clause.
This is because the `CREATE` clause comes before the `MATCH` clause and thus the `MATCH` can observe any changes to
the graph made by the `CREATE`.

======

[[cypher-clause-composition-call-queries]]
== Queries with `CALL {}` subqueries

Subqueries inside a xref::clauses/call-subquery.adoc[`CALL {}`] clause are evaluated for each incoming input row.
That means that write clauses inside a subquery can get executed more than once.
The different invocations of the subquery are executed in turn, in the order of the incoming input rows.

Later invocations of the subquery can observer writes made by earlier invocations of the subquery.

[[cypher-clause-composition-implementation]]
== Notes on the implementation

An easy way to implement the semantics outlined above is to fully execute each clause and
materialize the table of intermediate results before executing the next clause.
This approach would consume a lot of memory for materializing the tables of intermediate results and would generally not perform well.

Instead, Cypher will in general try to interleave the execution of clauses.
This is called xref::execution-plans/index.adoc#eagerness-laziness[lazy evaluation].
It only materializes intermediate results when needed.
In many read-write queries it is unproblematic to execute clauses interleaved, but when it is not,
Cypher must ensure that the table of intermediate results get materialized at the right time(s).
This is done by inserting an xref::execution-plans/operators.adoc#query-plan-eager[`Eager`] operator into the execution plan.
