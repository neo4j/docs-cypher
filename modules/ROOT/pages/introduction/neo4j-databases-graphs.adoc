This section describes databases and graphs in Neo4j.
--

Cypher queries are executed against a Neo4j database, but normally apply to specific graphs.
It is important to understand the meaning of these terms and exactly when a graph is not a database.

DBMS::
A Neo4j Database Management System is capable of containing and managing multiple graphs contained in databases.
Client applications will connect to the DBMS and open sessions against it.
A client session provides access to any graph in the DBMS.

Graph::
This is a data model within a database.
Normally there is only one graph within each database, and many xref::introduction/querying-updating-administering.adoc[administrative] commands that refer to a specific graph do so using the database name.
+
Cypher queries executed in a session may declare which graph they apply to, or use a default, given by the session.
+
Composite databases can contain multiple graphs, by means of aliases to other databases.
Queries submitted to composite databases may refer to multiple graphs within the same query.
+
For more information, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/composite-databases/[Operations manual -> Composite databases].

Database::
A database is a storage and retrieval mechanism for collecting data in a defined space on disk and in memory.

Most of the time Cypher queries are xref::introduction/querying-updating-administering.adoc[reading or updating queries], which are run against a graph.
There are also administrative commands that apply to a database, or to the entire DBMS.
Administrative commands cannot be run in a session connected to a normal user database, but instead need to be run within a session connected to the _system_ database.
Administrative commands execute on the _system_ database.
If an administrative command is submitted to a user database, it is rerouted to the _system_ database.

== The system database and the default database

All Neo4j servers contain a built-in database called `system`, which behaves differently than all other databases.
The `system` database stores system data and you can not perform graph queries against it.

A fresh installation of Neo4j includes two databases:

* `system` - the system database described above, containing meta-data on the DBMS and security configuration.
* `neo4j` - the default database, named using the config option `dbms.default_database=neo4j`.

For more information about the _system_ database, see the sections on xref::databases.adoc[Database management] and xref::access-control/index.adoc[Access control].

== Different editions of Neo4j

Neo4j has two editions, a commercial Enterprise Edition with additional performance and administrative features, and an open-source Community Edition.
Cypher works almost identically between the two editions, and as such most of this manual will not differentiate between them.
In the few cases where there is a difference in Cypher language support or behaviour between editions, these are highlighted as described below in xref::introduction/neo4j-databases-graphs.adoc#cypher-limited-support[].

However, it is worth listing up-front the key areas that are not supported in the open-source edition:

[options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Enterprise | Community

| xref::databases.adoc[Multi-database]
a|
Any number of user databases.
a|
Only `system` and one user database.

| Role-based security
a|
User, role, and privilege management for flexible xref::access-control/index.adoc[access control] and xref::access-control/manage-privileges.adoc[sub-graph access control].
a|
xref::access-control/manage-users.adoc[Multi-user management].
All users have full access rights.

| Constraints
a|
xref::constraints/examples.adoc#administration-constraints-prop-exist-nodes[Existence constraints], xref::constraints/examples.adoc#administration-constraints-unique-nodes[uniqueness constraints], and xref::constraints/examples.adoc#administration-constraints-node-key[`NODE KEY` constraints].
a|
Only xref::constraints/examples.adoc#administration-constraints-unique-nodes[uniqueness constraints].

[[cypher-limited-support]]
== Limited Support Features

Some elements of Cypher do not work in all deployments of Neo4j.

Specific labels are added to the documentation to highlight these cases.

[options="header"]
|===
| Description | Label

| This feature has been deprecated and will be removed or replaced in the future.
| label:deprecated[]

| This feature only works in the enterprise edition of Neo4j.
| label:enterprise-edition[]
