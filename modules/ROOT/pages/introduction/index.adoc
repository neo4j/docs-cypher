Welcome to the Neo4j Cypher Manual. 

Cypher is Neo4jâ€™s declarative query language, allowing users to unlock the full potential of property graph databases. 

For a reference of all available Cypher features, see the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-cheat-sheet/{page-version}/[Cypher Cheat Sheet].

This introduction will cover the following topics:

* xref:introduction/cypher_overview.adoc[]
* xref:introduction/cypher_tutorial.adoc[]
* xref:introduction/cypher_neo4j.adoc[]
* xref:introduction/cypher_aura.adoc[]

[[intended-readership]]
== Cypher Manual: intended readership

The Cypher Manual aims to be as instructive as possible to readers from a variety of backgrounds and professions, such as developers, administrators, and academic researchers. 
In so doing, it assumes a degree of prior knowledge of Cypher.

The Cypher Manual is, therefore, not primarily intended for beginners (in other words, readers who have never used Cypher before).
Beginners are instead encouraged to visit the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/getting-started/{page-version}/cypher-intro/[Cypher Getting Started Guide], and enroll in the free Cypher courses offered by https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/[Neo4j GraphAcademy].
