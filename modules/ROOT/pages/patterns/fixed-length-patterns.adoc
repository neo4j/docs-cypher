= Fixed length patterns

The most basic form of graph pattern matching in Cypher involves the matching of fixed length patterns.
This includes node patterns, relationship patterns, and path patterns.

[[node-patterns]]
== Node patterns

Every graph pattern contains at least one node pattern.
The simplest graph pattern is a single, empty node pattern:

[source, role=noheader]
----
MATCH ()
----

The empty node pattern matches every node in a property graph.
In order to obtain a reference to the nodes matched, a variable needs to be declared in the node pattern:

[source, role=noheader]
----
MATCH (n)
----

With this reference, node properties can be accessed:

[source, role=noheader]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n.name
----

Adding a label expression to the node pattern means only nodes with labels that match will be returned.
The following matches nodes that have the `Stop` label:

[source, role=noheader]
----
MATCH (n:Stop)
----

The following more complex label expression matches all nodes that are either a `TrainStation` and a `BusStation` or `StationGroup`:

[source, role=noheader]
----
MATCH (n:(TrainStation&BusStation)|StationGroup)
----

A map of property names and values can be used to match on node properties based on equality with the specified values.
The following matches nodes that have their `mode` property equal to `Rail`:

[source, role=noheader]
----
MATCH (n { mode: 'Rail' })
----

More general predicates can be expressed with a `WHERE` clause.
The following matches nodes whose name property starts with `Preston`:

[source, role=noheader]
----
MATCH (n:Station WHERE n.name STARTS WITH 'Preston')
----

See the xref:patterns/reference.adoc#node-patterns[node patterns] reference section for more details.

[[relationship-patterns]]
== Relationship patterns

The simplest possible relationship pattern is a pair of dashes:

[source, role=noheader]
----
--
----

This pattern matches a relationship with any direction and does not filter on any relationship type or property.
Unlike a node pattern, a relationship pattern cannot be used in a `MATCH` clause without node patterns at both ends.
See xref:patterns/fixed-length-patterns.adoc#path-patterns[path patterns] for more details.

In order to obtain a reference to the relationships matched by the pattern, a relationship variable needs to be declared in the pattern by adding the variable name in square brackets in between the dashes:

[source, role=noheader]
----
-[r]-
----

To match a specific direction, add `<` or `>` to the left or right hand side respectively:

[source, role=noheader]
----
-[r]->
----

To match on a relationship type, add the type name after a colon:

[source, role=noheader]
----
-[:CALLS_AT]->
----

Similar to node patterns, a map of property names and values can be added to filter on properties of the relationship based on equality with the specified values:

[source, role=noheader]
----
-[{ distance: 0.24, duration: 'PT4M' }]->
----

A `WHERE` clause can be used for more general predicates:

[source, role=noheader]
----
-[r WHERE time() + duration(r.duration) < time('22:00') ]->
----

See the xref:patterns/reference.adoc#relationship-patterns[relationship patterns] reference section for more details.

[[path-patterns]]
== Path patterns

Any valid path starts and ends with a node, with relationships between each node (if there is more than one node).
Fixed length path patterns have the same restrictions, and for all valid path patterns the following are true:

* They have at least one node pattern.
* They begin and end with a node pattern.
* They alternate between nodes and relationships.

These are all valid path patterns:

[source, role=noheader]
----
()
----
[source, role=noheader]
----
(s)--(e)
----
[source, role=noheader]
----
(:Station)--()<--(m WHERE m.departs > time('12:00'))-->()-[:NEXT]->(n)
----

These are invalid path patterns:

[source, role=noheader]
----
-->
----
[source, role=noheader]
----
()-->
----
[source, role=noheader]
----
()-->-->()
----

[[path-pattern-matching]]
== Path pattern matching

This section contains an example of matching a path pattern to paths in a property graph.

It uses the following graph:

image::path_pattern_example_graph.svg[width="600",role="middle"]

To recreate the graph, run the following query against an empty Neo4j database:

[source,cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE (pmr:Station {name: 'Peckham Rye'}),
  (dmk:Station {name: 'Denmark Hill'}),
  (vic:Station {name: 'London Victoria'}),
  (clp:Station {name: 'Clapham High Street'}),
  (eph:Station {name: 'Elephant & Castle'}),
  (vic)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s1:Stop {departs: time('11:55')}),
  (dmk)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s2:Stop {departs: time('11:44')})-[:NEXT]->(s1),
  (pmr)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s3:Stop {departs: time('11:40')})-[:NEXT]->(s2),
  (clp)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s4:Stop {departs: time('11:41')}),
  (dmk)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s5:Stop {departs: time('11:37')})-[:NEXT]->(s4),
  (pmr)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s6:Stop {departs: time('11:33')})-[:NEXT]->(s5),
  (eph)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s7:Stop {departs: time('11:54')}),
  (dmk)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s8:Stop {departs: time('11:47')})-[:NEXT]->(s7),
  (pmr)<-[:CALLS_AT]-(s9:Stop {departs: time('11:44')})-[:NEXT]->(s8)
----


The graph contains a number of train `Stations` and `Stops`.
A `Stop` represents  the arrival and departure of a train that `CALLS_AT` a `Station`.
Each `Stop` forms part of a sequence of `Stops` connected by relationships with the type `NEXT`, representing the order of calling points made by a train service.

The graph shows three chains of `Stops` that represent different train services.
Each of these services calls at the `Station` with the name `Denmark Hill`.

To return all `Stops` that call at the `Station` `Denmark Hill`, the following _motif_ is used (the term motif is used to describe the pattern looked for in the graph):

image::path_pattern_motif.svg[width="600",role="middle"]

In this case, three paths in the graph match the structure of the motif (plus the predicate anchoring to the `Station` `Denmark Hill`):

image::path_pattern_solutions.svg[width="700",role="middle"]

In order to return the name of each `Stop` that calls at a `Station`, declare a variable in the `Stop` node pattern.
The results will then have a row containing the departs value of each `Stop` for each match shown above:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (s:Stop)-[:CALLS_AT]->(:Station {name: 'Denmark Hill'})
RETURN s.departs AS departureTime
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| departureTime

| "11:44:00Z"
| "11:47:00Z"
| "11:37:00Z"
