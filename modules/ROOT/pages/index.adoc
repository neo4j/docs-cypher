*Cypher -- Neo4j’s graph database query language*

Cypher is Neo4j’s graph database query language that allows users to store and retrieve data from the graph database.
It is a declarative, SQL-inspired language for describing visual patterns in graphs.
The syntax provides a visual and logical way to match patterns of nodes and relationships in the graph.
