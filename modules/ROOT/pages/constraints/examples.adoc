== Node property uniqueness constraints

A node property uniqueness constraint ensures that certain nodes have a set of specified properties whose combined value is unique when all properties exist on the node.

=== Handling existing constraints when creating a constraint

Creating an already existing constraint will fail.
To avoid such an error, `IF NOT EXISTS` can be added to the `CREATE` command.
This will ensure that no error is thrown and that no constraint is created if any other constraint with the given name, or another node property uniqueness constraint on the same schema, already exists.

=== Specifying an index provider when creating a constraint

To create a property uniqueness constraint with a specific index provider for the backing index, the `OPTIONS` clause is used.

The index type of the backing index is set with the `indexProvider` option.

The only valid value for the index provider is:

* `range-1.0` label:default[]

// Only one valid value exists for the index provider in Neo4j 5.0

The constraint creation fails on the first offending nodes that are found.
This does not guarantee that there are no other offending nodes in the graph.
Therefore, all the data should be checked and cleaned up before re-attempting the constraint creation.

This is an example `MATCH` query to find all offending nodes with the non-unique property values for the constraint above:

== Relationship key constraints

_This feature was introduced in Neo4j 5.7._

A relationship key constraint ensures that certain relationships have a set of defined properties whose combined value is unique.
It also ensures that all properties in the set are present.

[NOTE]
====
The `type` column returns `UNIQUENESS` for the node property uniqueness constraint and `RELATIONSHIP_UNIQUENESS` for the relationship property uniqueness constraint.
This will be updated in Neo4j version 6.0.
Node property uniqueness constraints will be updated to `NODE_PROPERTY_UNIQUENESS` and relationship property uniqueness constraints to `RELATIONSHIP_PROPERTY_UNIQUENESS`.

=== Listing constraints with filtering

One way of filtering the output from `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` by constraint type is the use of constraint type keywords,
listed in the xref::constraints/syntax.adoc#constraints-syntax-list-type-filter[syntax for listing constraints type filter table].
For example, to show only property uniqueness constraints, use `SHOW UNIQUENESS CONSTRAINTS`.
Another more flexible way of filtering the output is to use the `WHERE` clause.
An example is to only show constraints on relationships.


.+SHOW CONSTRAINTS+
======

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
SHOW EXISTENCE CONSTRAINTS
WHERE entityType = 'RELATIONSHIP'
----

This will only return the default output columns.
To get all columns, use `+SHOW INDEXES YIELD * WHERE ...+`.
