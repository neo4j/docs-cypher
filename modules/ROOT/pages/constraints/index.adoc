Neo4j offers several constraints to ensure the quality and integrity of data in a graph.
The following constraints are available in Neo4j:

* *Property uniqueness constraints* ensure that the combined property values are unique for all nodes with a specific label or all relationships with a specific type. 
* *Property existence constraints* ensure that a property exists either for all nodes with a specific label or for all relationships with a specific type. label:enterprise-edition[]
* *Property type constraints* ensure that a property has the required property type for all nodes with a specific label or for all relationships with a specific type. label:new[Introduced in 5.9] label:enterprise-edition[]
* *Key constraints* ensure that all properties exist and that the combined property values are unique for all nodes with a specific label or all relationships with a specific type.label:enterprise-edition[]

To learn more about creating, listing, and dropping these constraints, as well as information about index-backed constraints, constraint creation failures and data violation scenarios, and more, see xref:constraints/managing-constraints.adoc[].
