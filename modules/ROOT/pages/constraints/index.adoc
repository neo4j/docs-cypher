Neo4j offers several constraints to ensure the quality and integrity of data in a graph.
For information about how to create, list, and drop these constraints, see:

* xref:constraints/managing-constraints.adoc#create-uniqueness-constraint[Uniqueness constraints]: ensures that property values are unique for all nodes with a specific label or all relationships with a specific type. 
* xref:constraints/managing-constraints.adoc#create-existence-constraint.adoc[Existence constraints]: ensures that a property exists either for all nodes with a specific label or for all relationships with a specific type. label:enterprise-edition[]
* xref:constraints/managing-constraints.adoc#create-type-constraint.adoc[Key constraints]: ensures that, for a given node label or relationship type and set of properties, all properties are present on the respective nodes or relationships, and the combination of property values is unique. label:enterprise-edition[]
* xref:constraints/managing-constraints.adoc#create-type-constraint.adoc[Type constraints]: ensures that a property have the required property type for all nodes with a specific label or for all relationships with a specific type. label:enterprise-edition[]

[NOTE]
Adding constraints is an atomic operation that can take a while -- all existing data has to be scanned before a Neo4j DBMS can use a constraint.

Reference material about the Cypher commands used to manage constraints can be found in xref:constraints/syntax.adoc[Constraints -> Syntax].
