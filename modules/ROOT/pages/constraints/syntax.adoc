[[constraints-syntax-create]]
== Syntax for creating constraints

Best practice when creating a constraint is to give the constraint a name.
This name must be unique among both indexes and constraints.
If a name is not explicitly given, a unique name will be auto-generated.

The `CREATE CONSTRAINT` command is optionally idempotent. 
This means its default behavior is to throw an error if an attempt is made to create the same constraint twice.
With the `IF NOT EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should a constraint with the same name or same schema and constraint type already exist.
It may still throw an error if conflicting data, indexes, or constraints exist.
Examples of this are nodes with missing properties, indexes with the same name, or constraints with same schema but a different conflicting constraint type.

For constraints that are backed by an index, the index provider for the backing index can be specified using the `OPTIONS` clause.
Only one valid value exists for the index provider, `range-1.0`, which is the default value.
There is no supported index configuration for range indexes.

[NOTE]
====
Creating a constraint requires the xref::administration/access-control/database-administration.adoc#access-control-database-administration-constraints[`CREATE CONSTRAINT` privilege].

The three variations of the expression, `IS ::`, `::`, and `IS TYPED`, is just syntactic synonyms for the same expression.
The preferred syntax is the `IS ::` variant.

Where `<TYPE>` is one of the following property types:

* `BOOLEAN`
* `STRING`
* `INTEGER`
* `FLOAT`
* `DATE`
* `LOCAL TIME`
* `ZONED TIME`
* `LOCAL DATETIME`
* `ZONED DATETIME`

[[constraints-syntax-drop]]
== Syntax for dropping constraints

Dropping a constraint is done by specifying the name of the constraint.

[source, syntax, role="noheader", indent=0]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name [IF EXISTS]
----

This drop command is optionally idempotent. This means its default behavior is to throw an error if an attempt is made to drop the same constraint twice.
With the `IF EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should the constraint not exist.

[NOTE]
====
Dropping a constraint requires the xref::administration/access-control/database-administration.adoc#access-control-database-administration-constraints[`DROP CONSTRAINT` privilege].
====


[[constraints-syntax-list]]
== Syntax for listing constraints

List constraints in the database, either all or filtered on constraint type.

[NOTE]
====
Listing constraints requires the xref::administration/access-control/database-administration.adoc#access-control-database-administration-constraints[`SHOW CONSTRAINTS` privilege].
====

The simple version of the command allows for a `WHERE` clause and will give back the default set of output columns:

[source, syntax, role="noheader", indent=0]
----
SHOW [
      ALL
     |NODE UNIQUE[NESS]
     |REL[ATIONSHIP] UNIQUE[NESS]
     |UNIQUE[NESS]
     |NODE [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]
     |REL[ATIONSHIP] [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]
     |[PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]
     |NODE PROPERTY TYPE
     |REL[ATIONSHIP] PROPERTY TYPE
     |PROPERTY TYPE
     |NODE KEY
     |REL[ATIONSHIP] KEY
     |KEY
] CONSTRAINT[S]
  [WHERE expression]
----

To get the full set of output columns, a yield clause is needed:

[source, syntax, role="noheader", indent=0]
----
SHOW [
      ALL
     |NODE UNIQUE[NESS]
     |REL[ATIONSHIP] UNIQUE[NESS]
     |UNIQUE[NESS]

     |NODE KEY
     |REL[ATIONSHIP] KEY
     |KEY
] CONSTRAINT[S]
YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]
  [WHERE expression]
  [RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
