This page contains the syntax for creating, listing, and dropping the constraints available in Neo4j.

More details about the syntax can be found in the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/database-administration/syntax/[Operations Manual -> Cypher syntax for administration commands].

[[constraints-syntax-create]]
== CREATE CONSTRAINT

Constraints are created with the `CREATE CONSTRAINT` command.
When creating a constraint, it is recommended to provide a constraint name.
This name must be unique among both indexes and constraints.
If a name is not explicitly given, a unique name will be auto-generated.

[NOTE]
Creating a constraint requires the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/database-administration/#access-control-database-administration-constraints[`CREATE CONSTRAINT` privilege].

The `CREATE CONSTRAINT` command is optionally idempotent. 
This means its default behavior is to throw an error if an attempt is made to create the same constraint twice.
With the `IF NOT EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should a constraint with the same name or same schema and constraint type already exist.
It may still throw an error if conflicting data, indexes, or constraints exist.
Examples of this are nodes with missing properties, indexes with the same name, or constraints with same schema but a different conflicting constraint type.
An informational notification is returned in case nothing happens showing the existing constraint which blocks the creation.

For constraints that are backed by an index, the index provider for the backing index can be specified using the `OPTIONS` clause.
Only one valid value exists for the index provider, `range-1.0`, which is the default value.
There is no supported index configuration for range indexes.

[OPTIONS "{" "}"]
----

The three variations of the expression, `IS ::`, `::`, and `IS TYPED` are syntactic synonyms for the same expression.
The preferred syntax is the `IS ::` variant.

Where `<TYPE>` is one of the following property types:

* `BOOLEAN`
* `STRING`
* `INTEGER`
* `FLOAT`
* `DATE`
* `LOCAL TIME`
* `ZONED TIME`
* `LOCAL DATETIME`
* `ZONED DATETIME`
* `DURATION`
* `POINT`
* `LIST<BOOLEAN NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<STRING NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<INTEGER NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<FLOAT NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<DATE NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<LOCAL TIME NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<ZONED TIME NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<LOCAL DATETIME NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<ZONED DATETIME NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<DURATION NOT NULL>`
* `LIST<POINT NOT NULL>`
* Any closed dynamic union of the above types, e.g. `INTEGER | FLOAT | STRING`.

Allowed syntax variations of these types are listed in  xref::values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#types-synonyms[Types and their synonyms].

There are no supported `OPTIONS` values for property type constraints, but an empty options map is allowed for consistency.

[[list-constraints]]
== SHOW CONSTRAINTS

To list all constraints with the default output columns, use `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`.
If all columns are required, use `SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD *`.
If only specific columns are required, use `SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD field[, ...]`.
The `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` clause can also be filtered using the xref:clauses/where.adoc[`WHERE`] clause.

[NOTE]
Listing constraints requires the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/database-administration/#access-control-database-administration-constraints[`SHOW CONSTRAINTS` privilege].

The type filtering keywords filters the returned constraints on constraint type:

[[drop-constraint]]
== DROP CONSTRAINT

Constraints are dropped using the `DROP` CONSTRAINT command.
Dropping a constraint is done by specifying the name of the constraint.

[NOTE]
Dropping a constraint requires the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/database-administration/#access-control-database-administration-constraints[`DROP CONSTRAINT` privilege].


.Syntax for dropping a constraint by name
[source, syntax]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name [IF EXISTS]
----

This command is optionally idempotent.
This means its default behavior is to throw an error if an attempt is made to drop the same constraint twice.
With the `IF EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should the constraint not exist.
Instead, an informational notification is returned detailing that the constraint does not exist.

For examples on how to drop constraints, see  xref:constraints/managing-constraints.adoc#drop-constraint[Create, show, and drop constraints -> DROP CONSTRAINT].
