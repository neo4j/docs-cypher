:description: Information about mandatory GQL features not currently supported by Cypher.
= Currently unsupported mandatory GQL features

Unlike optional GQL features, mandatory GQL features are not assigned a GQL code.
The below table is instead listed in order of their appearance in the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html[ISO/IEC 39075:2024 GQL Standard].

|===
| GQL Standard subclause
| Description
| Comment

| 4.9.2
| GQL-status objects
| Exposing successful execution results, errors, exceptions, and warnings as GQL-status objects.

| 4.16.2
| `BOOLEAN` types
| Cypher does not support the GQL `BOOLEAN` literal `UNKNOWN`.
Cypher also does not support `BOOLEAN` type predicate tests.

| 7.1-7.3
| Session management
| GQL defines the following session commands: `SESSION SET`, `SESSION RESET`, and `SESSION CLOSE`.

| 8.1-8.4
| Transaction management
| GQL defines the following transaction commands: `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.

Neo4j offers link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/tools/cypher-shell/#cypher-shell-commands[commands] to achieve similar results.

| 11.1
| Graph expressions
| GQL defines the following graph reference values commands: `CURRENT_GRAPH` and `CURRENT_PROPERTY_GRAPH`.

| 13.3
| `SET` statement
| GQL’s SET statement has no order dependencies because all right-hand side operations are completed before any assignments occur.
In Cypher’s xref:clauses/set.adoc[`SET`], the order of rows can affect the outcome because changes made during execution may depend on the sequence of assignments.
The only way to guarantee row order in Neo4j is to use xref:clauses/order-by[`ORDER BY`].

| 15.1 & 15.2
| `CALL` procedure statement & inline procedure `CALL`
| * GQL defines an `OPTIONAL CALL` statement, enabling optional procedure and subquery calling.
* GQL implicitly imports variables. In Cypher, `CALL` subqueries require an explicit xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc#call-importing-variables[importing `WITH` clause].

| 16.19
| `OFFSET` clause
| Cypher only supports xref:clauses/skip.adoc[`SKIP`].

| 17.1
| Schema reference
| GQL defines the following schema selection options: `HOME_SCHEMA` and `CURRENT_SCHEMA`.

| 20.3
| Value specification
| GQL defines the `SESSION_USER` value expression, which enables accessing a user’s username and password within a query.

| 20.9
| Aggregate functions
| Cypher and GQL handle `NULL` values differently for aggregate functions. 
For example, in GQL `RETURN sum(NULL)` returns `NULL`, but in Cypher it returns `0`.

| 20.24
| Character `STRING` functions`
| GQL defines the `UPPER` and `LOWER` folds, which are not included in Cypher.
However, Cypher includes two equivalent functions: xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-toupper[`toUpper()`] and xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-tolower[`toLower()`].

| 21.1
| Names and variables
| * GQL allows for extended parameter identifiers.
For example: `RETURN $0hello` is allowed in GQL but not Cypher.
* GQL allows identifiers that are not variables to be delimited with both backticks and quotes.
Cypher only allows backticks.
For example: `MATCH (n) RETURN n."a prop"` is allowed in GQL but not Cypher.

| 21.3
| <token>, <separator>, and <identifier>
| GQL specifies a list of reserved words that cannot be used for unquoted variable names, labels, and property names.
