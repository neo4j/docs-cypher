= Optional GQL features and analogous Cypher 

This page lists optional GQL features that have analogous but not identical Cypher features.

Optional GQL features are assigned a feature ID.
These codes order the features in the table below.

|===
| GQL Feature ID
| Description
| Comment

| G100
| `ELEMENT_ID` function
| GQL's `ELEMENT_ID()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-elementid[`elementId()`] function.

| GF01
| Enhanced numeric functions
| GQL supports `CEILING()` as a synonym to the `CEIL()` function.
Cypher only supports xref:functions/mathematical-numeric.adoc#functions-ceil[`ceil()`].

| GF03
| Logarithmic functions
| * Cypher uses the xref:functions/mathematical-logarithmic.adoc#functions-log[`log()`] function instead of GQL's `LN()` function.
* Cypher uses the xref:syntax/operators.adoc##syntax-using-the-exponentiation-operator[exponentiation operator (`^`)] instead of GQL's `POWER()` function. 

| GF04
| Enhanced path functions
| GQL's `PATH_LENGTH()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/scalar/functions-length[`length()`] function.

| GF10
| Advanced aggregate functions: general set functions
| * GQL's `COLLECT_LIST()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-collect[`collect()`] function.
* GQL's `STDEV_SAMP()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-stdev[`stDev()`] function.
* GQL's `STDEV_POP()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-stdevp[`stDevP()`] function.

| GF11
| Advanced aggregate functions: binary set functions
| * GQL's `PERCENTILE_CONT()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-percentilecont[`percentileCont()`] function.
* GQL's `PERCENTILE_DISC()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-percentiledisc[`stDev()`] function.

| GQ08
| `FILTER` statement
| Selects a subset of the records of the current working table.
Cypher uses xref:clauses/with.adoc[`WITH`] instead.

| GQ09
| `LET` statement
| Adds columns to the current working table.
Cypher uses xref:clauses/with.adoc[`WITH`] instead.

| GQ10, GQ11, GQ23, GQ24
| `FOR` statement: list value support, binding table support, `WITH ORDINALITY`, `WITH OFFSET`
| Unnests a list or a binding table by expanding the current working table.
Cypher uses xref:clauses/unwind.adoc[`UNWIND`] instead.
Unlike the `FOR` statement, `UNWIND` does not support yielding indexes and offsets.

| GV12
| 64-bit signed integer numbers
| GQL’s `SIGNED INTEGER64` (alternatively: `INTEGER64`, `INT64`) type is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#_property_type_details[`INTEGER`] type.

| GV23
| Floating point type name synonyms
| GQL’s `DOUBLE`  type is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#_property_type_details[`FLOAT`] type.

| GV24
| 64-bit floating number
| GQL’s `FLOAT64`  type is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#_property_type_details[`FLOAT`] type.

| GV39
| xref:values-and-types/temporal.adoc[Temporal types: date, local datetime, and local time support]
| Cypher supports GQL’s local temporal types, with the following exceptions:

* The following GQL local temporal type synonyms are not in Cypher: `TIME WITHOUT TIME ZONE` and `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`.
* GQL defines a parameterless version of the xref:functions/temporal/index.adoc#functions-date[`date()`] function not in Cypher: `CURRENT_DATE`.
* GQL’s `LOCAL_TIME()` function is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:functions/temporal/index.adoc#functions-localtime[`localtime()`] function.
GQL also defines a parameterless version of the function not in Cypher: `LOCAL_TIME`.
* GQL’s `LOCAL_DATETIME()` function is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:functions/temporal/index.adoc#functions-localdatetime[`localdatetime()`] function.
GQL also defines a parameterless version of the function not in Cypher: `LOCAL_DATETIME`.

| GV40
| xref:values-and-types/temporal.adoc[Temporal types: zoned datetime and zoned time support]
| Cypher supports GQL’s zoned temporal types, with the following exceptions:

* The following GQL zoned temporal type synonyms are not in Cypher: `TIME WITH TIME ZONE` and `TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE`. 
* GQL’s `ZONED_TIME()` function is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:functions/temporal/index.adoc#functions-time[`time()`] function.
GQL also defines a parameterless version of the function not in Cypher: `CURRENT_TIME`.
* GQL’s `ZONED_DATETIME()` function is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:functions/temporal/index.adoc#functions-datetime[`datetime()`] function.
GQL also defines a parameterless version of the function not in Cypher: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.

| GV45
| Record types
| GQL's open `RECORD` type is equivalent to the xref:values-and-types/maps.adoc[`MAP`] type in Cypher.
