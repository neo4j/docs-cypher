:description: Information about mandatory GQL features supported by Cypher.
= Supported mandatory GQL features

Unlike optional GQL features, mandatory GQL features are not assigned a GQL feature ID code.
The below table is instead listed in order of their appearance in the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html[ISO/IEC 39075:2024(en) GQL Standard].

| GQL Standard subclause
| Description
| Comment

| 4.11
| Graph pattern matching
| See the section on xref:patterns/index.adoc[] for more details.

| 4.13
| GQL object types
| Referred to as xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#structural-types[structural types] in Cypher.
Includes: `NODE` (`ANY NODE`, `VERTEX`, `ANY VERTEX`) and `RELATIONSHIP` (`ANY RELATIONSHIP`, `EDGE`, `ANY EDGE`).

| 4.16
| Predefined value types
| Referred to as xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#property-types[property types] in Cypher.
Includes: `BOOLEAN` (`BOOL`), `FLOAT`, `INTEGER` (`SIGNED INTEGER`, `INT`), and `STRING` (`VARCHAR`).

Cypher supports the Boolean literals `TRUE` and `FALSE`, but not GQL's `UNKNOWN`.

| 13.2
| <insert statement>
| xref:clauses/create.adoc#insert-as-synonym-of-create[`INSERT`]

| 13.3
| <set statement>
| GQL’s `SET` has no order dependencies because all right-hand side operations are completed before any assignments occur.
In Cypher’s xref:clauses/set.adoc[`SET`], the order of rows can affect the outcome because changes made during execution may depend on the sequence of assignments.
The only way to guarantee row order in Neo4j is to use xref:clauses/order-by.adoc[`ORDER BY`]. 

| 13.4
| <remove statement>
| xref:clauses/remove.adoc[`REMOVE`]

| 13.5
| <delete statement>
| xref:clauses/delete.adoc[`DELETE`]

| 14.4
| <match statement>
| xref:clauses/match.adoc[`MATCH`], xref:clauses/optional-match.adoc[`OPTIONAL MATCH`]

| 14.9
| <order by and page statement>
| Cypher only supports xref:clauses/skip.adoc[`SKIP`], not GQL's `OFFSET`.


| 14.10
| <primitive result statement>
| xref:clauses/finish.adoc[`FINISH`]

| 14.11
| <return statement>
| xref:clauses/return.adoc[`RETURN`]

| 14.11
| <return statement>
| xref:clauses/return.adoc[`RETURN`]

| 15.1
| <call procedure statement> and <procedure call>
| The `CALL` clause can be used in Cypher to xref:clauses/call.adoc[call procedures] and xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc[invoke subqueries].

GQL defines an `OPTIONAL CALL` statement, enabling optional procedure and subquery calling.
This is not available in Cypher.

| 15.2
| <inline procedure call>
| xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc[`CALL` subqueries].

GQL either imports variables implicitly, or explicitly using a variable scope clause.
In Cypher, `CALL` subqueries require an explicit importing `WITH` clause.

| 15.3
| <named procedure call>
| xref:clauses/call.adoc[`CALL` procedure]

| 16.2
| <limit clause>
| xref:clauses/limit.adoc[`LIMIT`]

| 16.4
| <graph pattern>
| xref:patterns/reference.adoc#graph-patterns[Graph patterns]

| 16.5
| <insert graph pattern>
| See the xref:clauses/create.adoc#[`CREATE`] page for more details.

| 16.6
| <order by clause>
| xref:clauses/order-by.adoc[`ORDER-BY`]

| 16.7
| <path pattern expression>
| xref:patterns/reference.adoc#path-patterns[Path patterns]

| 16.8
| <label expression>
| xref:patterns/reference.adoc#label-expressions[Label expressions]

| 16.9
| <path variable reference>
| See xref:patterns/reference.adoc[Patterns -> Syntax and semantics] for more details.

| 16.11
| <graph pattern quantifier>
| xref:patterns/reference.adoc#quantifiers[Quantifiers]

| 16.17
| <sort specification list>
| xref:clauses/order-by.adoc#order-nodes-in-descending-order[Order results in ascending or descending order].

| 16.19
| <offset clause>
| Cypher only supports xref:clauses/skip.adoc[`SKIP`], which is a GQL-supported synonym to `OFFSET`.

| 16.19
| <offset clause>
| Cypher only supports xref:clauses/skip.adoc[`SKIP`], which is a GQL-supported synonym to `OFFSET`.

| 19.3
| <comparison predicate>
| Includes the following xref:syntax/operators.adoc##query-operators-comparison[comparison operators]: equals (`=`), not equals (`<>`), less than (`<`), greater than (`>`),  less than or equals (`<=`), and greater than or equals (`=>`).

| 19.4
| <exists predicate>
| xref:functions/predicate.adoc#function-exists[`exists()`]

| 19.5
| <null predicate>
| xref:values-and-types/type-predicate.adoc#type-predicate-null[Type predicate expressions for `NULL`]

| 19.6
| <value type predicate>
| xref:values-and-types/type-predicate.adoc#[]

| 19.7
| <normalized predicate>
| Includes the following string operators: xref:syntax/operators.adoc#match-string-is-normalized[`IS NORMALIZED`] and xref:syntax/operators.adoc#match-string-is-not-normalized[IS NOT NORMALIZED`].

| 20.2
| <value expression primary>
|

| 20.3
| <value specification>
| GQL defines the `SESSION_USER` value expression, which enables accessing a user’s username within a query.
In Cypher, current user details can be seen using the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/manage-users/#access-control-current-users[`SHOW CURRENT USER` command].

| 20.7
| <case expression>
| Includes xref:queries/case.adoc[`CASE`], xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-nullIf[`nullIf()`], and xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-coalesce[`coalesce()`].

| 20.2
| <value expression primary>
|

| 20.9
| <aggregate function>
| Includes: xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-avg[`avg()`], xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-count[`count()`], xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-max[`max`], xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-mind[`min()`], and xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-sum[`sum()`].

Cypher and GQL handle `NULL` values differently for the `sum()` function when queries return 0 rows. 
For example, `RETURN sum(<expr>)` on an empty table returns `NULL` in GQL, but in Cypher it returns `0`.

| 20.11
| <property reference>
|

| 20.21
| <numeric value expression>
| Includes the following xref:syntax/operators.adoc#query-operators-mathematical[mathematical operators]: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

| 20.22
| <numeric value function>
| Includes xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-char_length[`char_length()`] and xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-character_length[`character_length()`]. 

| 20.23
| <string value expression>
| xref:syntax/operators.adoc#syntax-concatenating-two-strings-doublebar[String concatenation operator (`\|\|`)]

| 20.24
| <character string function>
| Includes xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-left[`left()`], xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-lower[`lower()`], xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-normalize[`normalize()`], xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-right[`right()`], xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-trim[`trim()`], and xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-upper[`upper()`].

In GQL, `TRIM()` removes only space characters.
In Cypher, `trim()` removes any whitespace character.

| 21.1
| Names and variables
| Cypher supports GQL’s lexical elements, with the following caveats:

* GQL allows for extended parameter identifiers.
For example: `RETURN $0hello` is allowed in GQL but not Cypher.
* GQL allows identifiers that are not variables to be delimited with both backticks and quotes.
Cypher only allows backticks.
For example: `MATCH (n) RETURN n."a prop"` is allowed in GQL but not Cypher.
