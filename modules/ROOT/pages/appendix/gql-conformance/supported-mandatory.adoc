= Supported mandatory GQL features

Unlike optional GQL features, mandatory GQL features are not assigned a GQL feature ID code.
The below table is instead listed in order of their appearance in the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html[ISO/IEC 39075:2024(en) GQL Standard].

| GQL Standard subclause
| Description
| Comment

| 4.11
| Graph pattern matching
| See the section on xref:patterns/index.adoc[] for more details.

| 4.13
| GQL object types
| Referred to as xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#structural-types[structural types] in Cypher.
Includes: `NODE` (`ANY NODE`, `VERTEX`, `ANY VERTEX`) and `RELATIONSHIP` (`ANY RELATIONSHIP`, `EDGE`, `ANY EDGE`).

| 4.16
| Predefined value types
| Referred to as xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#property-types[property types] in Cypher.
Includes: `BOOLEAN` (`BOOL`), `FLOAT`, `INTEGER` (`SIGNED INTEGER`, `INT`), and `STRING` (`VARCHAR`).

Cypher supports the Boolean literals `TRUE` and `FALSE`, but not `UNKNOWN`.

| 13.2
| <insert statement>
| xref:clauses/create.adoc#insert-as-synonym-of-create[`INSERT`]

| 13.3
| <set statement>
| GQL’s `SET` has no order dependencies because all right-hand side operations are completed before any assignments occur.
In Cypher’s xref:clauses/set.adoc[`SET`], the order of rows can affect the outcome because changes made during execution may depend on the sequence of assignments.
The only way to guarantee row order in Neo4j is to use xref:clauses/order-by.adoc[`ORDER BY`]. 

| 13.4
| <remove statement>
| xref:clauses/remove.adoc[`REMOVE`]

| 13.4
| <remove statement>
| xref:clauses/remove.adoc[`REMOVE`]

| 13.5
| <delete statement>
| xref:clauses/delete.adoc[`DELETE`]

| 14.4
| <match statement>
| xref:clauses/match.adoc[`MATCH`], xref:clauses/optional-match.adoc[`OPTIONAL MATCH`]

| 14.9
| <order by and page statement>
| Cypher only supports xref:clauses/skip.adoc[`SKIP`], not GQL's `OFFSET`.


| 14.10
| <primitive result statement>
| xref:clauses/finish.adoc[`FINISH`]

| 14.11
| <return statement>
| xref:clauses/return.adoc[`RETURN`]

| 14.11
| <return statement>
| xref:clauses/return.adoc[`RETURN`]

| 15.1
| <call procedure statement> and <procedure call>
| GQL defines an `OPTIONAL CALL` statement, enabling optional procedure and subquery calling.
This is not available in Cypher.

| 15.2
| <inline procedure call>
| xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc[`CALL` subqueries].
GQL either imports variables implicitly, or explicitly using a variable scope clause.
In Cypher, `CALL` subqueries require an explicit importing `WITH` clause.

| 15.3
| <named procedure call>
| xref:clauses/call.adoc[`CALL` procedure]

| 16.2
| <limit clause>
| xref:clauses/limit.adoc[`LIMIT`]

| 16.4
| <graph pattern>
|

| 16.5
| <insert graph pattern>
| See the xref:clauses/create.adoc#[`CREATE`] page for more details.

| 16.6
| <order by clause>
| xref:clauses/order-by.adoc[`ORDER-BY`]

| 16.7
| <path pattern expression>
|

| 16.8
| <label expression>
| xref:patterns/reference.adoc#label-expressions[]

| 16.9
| <path variable reference>
|

| 16.11
| <graph pattern quantifier>
| xref:patterns/reference.adoc#quantifiers[]

| 16.17
| <sort specification list>
| xref:clauses/order-by.adoc#order-nodes-in-descending-order[Order results in ascending or descending order].

| 16.19
| <offset clause>
| Cypher only supports xref:clauses/skip.adoc[`SKIP`], which is a GQL-supported synonym to `OFFSET`.

| 16.19
| <offset clause>
| Cypher only supports xref:clauses/skip.adoc[`SKIP`], which is a GQL-supported synonym to `OFFSET`.

| 19.3
| <comparison predicate>
| Includes the following xref:syntax/operators.adoc##query-operators-comparison[comparison operators]: equals (`=`), not equals (`<>`), less than (`<`), greater than (`>`),  less than or equals (`<=`), and greater than or equals (`=>`).

| 19.4
| <exists predicate>
| xref:functions/predicate.adoc#function-exists[`exists()`]

| 19.5
| <null predicate>
| xref:values-and-types/type-predicate.adoc#type-predicate-null[Type predicate expressions for `NULL`]

| 19.6
| <value type predicate>
| xref:values-and-types/type-predicate.adoc#[]

| 19.7
| <normalized predicate>
| Includes the following string operators: xref:syntax/operators.adoc#match-string-is-normalized[`IS NORMALIZED`] and xref:syntax/operators.adoc#match-string-is-not-normalized[IS NOT NORMALIZED`].
