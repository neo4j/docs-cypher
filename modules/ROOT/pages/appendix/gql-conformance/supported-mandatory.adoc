:description: Information about mandatory GQL features supported by Cypher.
= Supported mandatory GQL features

Unlike optional GQL features, mandatory GQL features are not assigned a GQL feature ID code.
The below table is instead listed in order of their appearance in the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html[ISO/IEC 39075:2024(en) GQL Standard].

| 4.13
| GQL object types
| xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#structural-types[Structural types],  xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#type-synonyms[Types and their synonyms].
| Includes: `NODE` (`ANY NODE`, `VERTEX`, `ANY VERTEX`) and `RELATIONSHIP` (`ANY RELATIONSHIP`, `EDGE`, `ANY EDGE`).

| 4.16
| Predefined value types
| xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#property-types[Property types], xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#type-synonyms[Types and their synonyms].
| Includes: `BOOLEAN` (`BOOL`), `FLOAT`, `INTEGER` (`SIGNED INTEGER`, `INT`), and `STRING` (`VARCHAR`).

Cypher supports the boolean type predicate for `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL` but does not support the GQL keyword `UNKNOWN`.

| 13.2
| <insert statement>
| xref:clauses/create.adoc#insert-as-synonym-of-create[`INSERT`]
|

| 13.3
| <set statement>
| xref:clauses/set.adoc[`SET`]
| GQL’s `SET` has no order dependencies because all right-hand side operations are completed before any assignments occur.
In Cypher’s `SET`, the order of rows can affect the outcome because changes made during execution may depend on the sequence of assignments.
The only way to guarantee row order in Neo4j is to use xref:clauses/order-by.adoc[`ORDER BY`].

| Cypher only supports `SKIP`, which is a GQL-supported synonym to `OFFSET`.

| <value expression primary>
| xref:queries/expressions.adoc[]
|

| 20.3
| <value specification>
| 
| GQL defines the `SESSION_USER` value expression, which enables accessing a user’s username within a query.
In Cypher, current user details can be seen using the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/manage-users/#access-control-current-users[`SHOW CURRENT USER` command].

| 20.7
| <case expression>
| xref:queries/case.adoc[`CASE`], xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-nullIf[`nullIf()`], xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-coalesce[`coalesce()`]

| 20.9
| <aggregate function>
| xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-avg[`avg()`], xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-count[`count()`], xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-max[`max`], xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-mind[`min()`], xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-sum[`sum()`]
| Cypher and GQL handle `NULL` values differently for the `sum()` function when queries return 0 rows. 
For example, `RETURN sum(<expr>)` on an empty table returns `NULL` in GQL, but in Cypher it returns `0`.

| In GQL, `TRIM()` removes only space characters.
In Cypher, `trim()` removes any whitespace character.

| 21.1
| Names and variables
| xref:syntax/index.adoc[]
| Cypher supports GQL’s lexical elements, with the following caveats:

* GQL allows for extended parameter identifiers.
For example: `RETURN $0hello` is allowed in GQL but not Cypher.
* GQL allows identifiers that are not variables to be delimited with both backticks and quotes.
Cypher only allows backticks.
For example: `MATCH (n) RETURN n."a prop"` is allowed in GQL but not Cypher.
