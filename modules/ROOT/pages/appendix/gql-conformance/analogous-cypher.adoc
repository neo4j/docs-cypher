:description: Information about optional GQL features and their analogous Cypher features.
= Optional GQL features and analogous Cypher 

This page lists optional GQL features that have analogous but not identical Cypher features.

Optional GQL features are assigned a feature ID code.
These codes order the features in the table below.

| GQL Feature ID
| Description
| Comment and similar Cypher functionality

| G100
| `ELEMENT_ID` function
| GQL's `ELEMENT_ID()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-elementid[`elementId()`] function.

| GF04
| Enhanced path functions
| GQL's `PATH_LENGTH()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-length[`length()`] function.

| GF10
| Advanced aggregate functions: general set functions
| * GQL's `COLLECT_LIST()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-collect[`collect()`] function.
* GQL's `STDEV_SAMP()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-stdev[`stDev()`] function.
* GQL's `STDEV_POP()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-stdevp[`stDevP()`] function.

| GF11
| Advanced aggregate functions: binary set functions
| * GQL's `PERCENTILE_CONT()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-percentilecont[`percentileCont()`] function.
* GQL's `PERCENTILE_DISC()` function is equivalent to Cypher's xref:functions/aggregating.adoc#functions-percentiledisc[`percentileDisc()`] function.

| GQ08
| `FILTER` statement
| Selects a subset of the records of the current working table.
Cypher uses xref:clauses/with.adoc[`WITH`] instead.

| GQ09
| `LET` statement
| Adds columns to the current working table.
Cypher uses xref:clauses/with.adoc[`WITH`] instead.

| GQ10, GQ11, GQ23, GQ24
| `FOR` statement: list value support, binding table support, `WITH ORDINALITY`, `WITH OFFSET`
| Unnests a list or a binding table by expanding the current working table.
Cypher uses xref:clauses/unwind.adoc[`UNWIND`] instead.
Unlike the `FOR` statement, `UNWIND` does not support yielding indexes and offsets.

| GV12
| 64-bit signed integer numbers
| GQL’s `SIGNED INTEGER64` (alternatively: `INTEGER64`, `INT64`) type is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#_property_type_details[`INTEGER`] type.

| GV23
| Floating point type name synonyms
| GQL’s `DOUBLE`  type is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#_property_type_details[`FLOAT`] type.

| GV24
| 64-bit floating number
| GQL’s `FLOAT64`  type is equivalent to Cypher’s xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#_property_type_details[`FLOAT`] type.

| GV45
| Record types
| GQL's open `RECORD` type is equivalent to the xref:values-and-types/maps.adoc[`MAP`] type in Cypher.
