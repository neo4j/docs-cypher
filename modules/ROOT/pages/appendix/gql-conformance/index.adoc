:description: Overview of Cypher's conformance to GQL.
= GQL conformance

*Last updated*: 9 August 2024 +
*Neo4j version*: 5.23

GQL is the new link:https://www.iso.org/home.html[ISO] International Standard query language for graph databases.

GQL has adopted much of Cypher’s query construction semantics, such as adhering to the `MATCH/RETURN` format.
Consequently, Cypher now accommodates most mandatory GQL features and a substantial portion of its optional ones (defined by the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html[ISO/IEC 39075:2024(en) - Information technology - Database languages - GQL Standard]).
Users should, therefore, only expect minimal differences between crafting queries in Cypher and GQL.
For example, the following query is valid in both languages:

.Cypher and GQL
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE a.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN m.title
----

Cypher supports the majority of mandatory GQL features.
For a full list, see xref:appendix/gql-conformance/supported-mandatory.adoc[].
There are, however, currently a few mandatory GQL features not implemented in Cypher.
These are listed in the page xref:appendix/gql-conformance/unsupported-mandatory.adoc[].

Neo4j is also working towards increasing its support of optional GQL features.
These are listed in the page xref:appendix/gql-conformance/supported-optional.adoc[].

Additionally, some optional GQL features not yet implemented in Cypher already have analogous Cypher equivalents.
These features are listed in the page xref:appendix/gql-conformance/analogous-cypher.adoc[].

[[gql-minimum-conformance]]
== Note on minimum GQL conformance

Following the GQL Standard subclause 24.2, _Minimum conformance_, Cypher’s support of the following mandatory GQL features is explicitly declared:

* Graph with an open graph type (Feature GG01).
* The Unicode Standard version used by Cypher depends on the running JVM version.
Neo4j 5 added support for JavaSE 17 and version 13 of The Unicode Standard.
Neo4j 5.14 added support for JavaSE 21 and version 15 of the Unicode Standard.
For more information, see xref:syntax/parsing.adoc##_using_unicodes_in_cypher[Parsing -> Using Unicode in Cypher].
* Cypher supports the following mandatory GQL property types: `BOOLEAN` (`BOOL`), `FLOAT` footnote:[The `FLOAT` type in Cypher always represents a 64-bit double-precision floating point number.], `INTEGER` (`SIGNED INTEGER`, or `INT`)footnote:[The `INTEGER` type in Cypher always represents a 64-bit `INTEGER`.], and `STRING` (`VARCHAR`).
+
Cypher also supports the following optional GQL property types: `DATE`, `DURATION`, `LIST<INNER_TYPE NOT NULL>` (`ARRAY<INNER_TYPE NOT NULL>`, `INNER_TYPE LIST`, or `INNER_TYPE ARRAY`)footnote:[The `INNER_TYPE` cannot be a `LIST` type.], `LOCAL DATETIME` (`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`), `LOCAL TIME` (`TIME WITHOUT TIME ZONE`), `POINT`, `ZONED DATETIME` (`TIME WITH TIME ZONE`), and `ZONED TIME` (`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`).
