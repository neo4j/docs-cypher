= Database management

[abstract]
--
This section explains how to use Cypher to manage databases in Neo4j DBMS: creating, modifying, deleting, starting, and stopping individual databases within a single server.
--

Neo4j supports the management of multiple databases within the same DBMS.
The metadata for these databases, including the associated security model, is maintained in a special database called the `system` database.
All multi-database administrative commands must be run against the `system` database.
These administrative commands are automatically routed to the `system` database when connected to the DBMS over Bolt.

The syntax of the database management commands is as follows:

== Listing databases

There are four different commands for listing databases:

* Listing all databases.
* Listing a particular database.
* Listing the default database.
* Listing the home database.

These commands return the following columns:

|===


[NOTE]
====
The results of this command are filtered according to the `ACCESS` privileges of the user.
However, some privileges enable users to see additional databases regardless of their `ACCESS` privileges:

* Users with `CREATE/DROP/ALTER DATABASE` or `SET DATABASE ACCESS` privileges can see all standard databases.
* Users with `CREATE/DROP COMPOSITE DATABASE` or `COMPOSITE DATABASE MANAGEMENT` privileges can see all composite databases.
* Users with `DATABASE MANAGEMENT` privilege can see all databases.

If a user has not been granted `ACCESS` privilege to any databases nor any of the above special cases, the command can still be executed but will only return the `system` database, which is always visible.
====
[NOTE]
====
Databases hosted on servers that are offline are also returned by the `SHOW DATABASES` command.
For such databases, the `address` column displays `NULL`, the `currentStatus` column displays `unknown`, and the `statusMessage` displays `Server is unavailable`.
====

======


.+SHOW DATABASES+
======

In this example, the detailed information for a particular database can be displayed using the command `SHOW DATABASE name YIELD *`.
When a `YIELD` clause is provided, the full set of columns is returned.

.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-result-skip]

|===

======


.+SHOW HOME DATABASE+
======

The home database for the current user can be seen using the command `SHOW HOME DATABASE`.

.Query

11+d|Rows: 1

|===

======


.+SHOW DATABASES+
======

It is also possible to filter and sort the results by using `YIELD`, `ORDER BY`, and `WHERE`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name, currentStatus, requestedStatus
ORDER BY currentStatus
WHERE name CONTAINS 'o'
----

In this example:

* The number of columns returned has been reduced with the `YIELD` clause.
* The order of the returned columns has been changed.
* The results have been filtered to only show database names containing `'o'`.
* The results are ordered by the `currentStatus` column using `ORDER BY`.

It is also possible to use `SKIP` and `LIMIT` to paginate the results.


.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="3*<m"]
|===

| +name+ | +currentStatus+ | +requestedStatus+
| +"movies"+ | +"online"+ | +"online"+
| +"neo4j"+ | +"online"+ | +"online"+
3+d|Rows: 2

|===


[NOTE]
====
Note that for failed databases, the `currentStatus` and `requestedStatus` are different.
This often implies an error, but **does not always**.
For example, a database may take a while to transition from `offline` to `online` due to performing recovery.
Or, during normal operation a database's `currentStatus` may be transiently different from its `requestedStatus` due to a necessary automatic process, such as one Neo4j instance copying store files from another.
The possible statuses are `initial`, `online`, `offline`, `store copying` and `unknown`.
====

For composite databases the `constituents` column is particularly interesting as it lists the aliases that make up the composite database:

////
[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE COMPOSITE DATABASE `library` WAIT;
CREATE DATABASE `sci-fi` WAIT;

[[administration-databases-create-database]]
== Creating databases

Databases can be created using `CREATE DATABASE`.

Database names are subject to the xref::syntax/naming.adoc[standard Cypher restrictions on valid identifiers].

The following naming rules apply:

* Database name length must be between 3 and 63 characters.
* The first character must be an ASCII alphabetic character.
* Subsequent characters can be ASCII alphabetic (`mydatabase`), numeric characters (`mydatabase2`), dots (`main.db`), and dashes (enclosed within backticks, e.g., `CREATE DATABASE ++`main-db`++`).
Using database names with dots without enclosing them in backticks is deprecated.
* Names cannot end with dots or dashes.
* Names that begin with an underscore or with the prefix `system` are reserved for internal use.

[NOTE]
====
Having dots (`.`) in the database names is not recommended.
This is due to the difficulty of determining if a dot is part of the database name or a delimiter for a database alias in a composite database.

[[administration-databases-create-database-topology]]
=== Cluster topology

In a cluster environment, it may be desirable to control the number of servers used to host a database.
The number of primary and secondary servers can be specified using the following command.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE `topology-example` TOPOLOGY 1 PRIMARY 0 SECONDARIES
----

For more details on primary and secondary server roles, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/clustering#clustering-introduction-operational[Cluster overview].

[NOTE]
====
`TOPOLOGY` is only available for standard databases and not composite databases.
Composite databases are always available on all servers.
====


[role=enterprise-edition]
[[administration-databases-create-composite-database]]
=== Creating composite databases

Composite databases do not contain data, but they reference to other databases that can be queried together through their constituent aliases.
For more information about composite databases, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/composite-databases/introduction[Operations Manual -> Composite database introduction].

Composite databases can be created using `CREATE COMPOSITE DATABASE`.

Composite database names are subject to the same rules as xref:administration-databases-create-database[standard databases].
One difference is however that the deprecated syntax using dots without enclosing the name in backticks is not available.
Both dots and dashes need to be enclosed within backticks when using composite databases.

[NOTE]
====
Having dots (`.`) in the composite database names is not recommended.
This is due to the difficulty of determining if a dot is part of the composite database name or a delimiter for a database alias in a composite database.
====

.Query

In order to create database aliases in the composite database, give the composite database as namespace for the alias.
For information about creating aliases in composite databases, see xref:aliases.adoc#alias-management-create-composite-database-alias[here].


[role=enterprise-edition]
[[administration-databases-create-database-existing]]
=== Handling Existing Databases

These commands are optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to fail with an error if the database already exists.
Appending `IF NOT EXISTS` to the command ensures that no error is returned and nothing happens should the database already exist.
Adding `OR REPLACE` to the command will result in any existing database being deleted and a new one created.

These behavior flags apply to both standard and composite databases (e.g. a composite database may replace a standard one or another composite.)


.+CREATE DATABASE+
======

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE COMPOSITE DATABASE customers IF NOT EXISTS
----


======


.+CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE+
======

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE customers
----

This is equivalent to running `DROP DATABASE customers IF EXISTS` followed by `CREATE DATABASE customers`.

[NOTE]
====
The `IF NOT EXISTS` and `OR REPLACE` parts of these commands cannot be used together.
====

======


[role=enterprise-edition]
[[administration-databases-create-database-options]]
=== Options

The `CREATE DATABASE` command can have a map of options, e.g. `OPTIONS {key: 'value'}`.

[NOTE]
====
There are no available `OPTIONS` values for composite databases.
====


[options="header"]
|===

| Key | Value | Description

| `existingData`
| `use`
|
Controls how the system handles existing data on disk when creating the database.
Currently this is only supported with `existingDataSeedInstance` and must be set to `use` which indicates the existing data files should be used for the new database.

| `existingDataSeedInstance`
| instance ID of the cluster node
|
Defines which instance is used for seeding the data of the created database.
The instance id can be taken from the id column of the `dbms.cluster.overview()` procedure. Can only be used in clusters.

| `seedURI`
| URI to a backup or a dump from an existing database.
|
Defines an identical seed from an external source which will be used to seed all servers.

| `seedConfig`
| comma separated list of configuration values.
|
Defines additional configuration specified by comma separated `name=value` pairs that might be required by certain seed providers.

| `seedCredentials`
| credentials
|
Defines credentials that needs to be passed into certain seed providers.

|===


[NOTE]
====
The `existingData`, `existingDataSeedInstance`, `seedURI`, `seedConfig` and `seedCredentials` options cannot be combined with the `OR REPLACE` part of this command.
For details about the use of these seeding options, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/clustering/databases/#cluster-seed[Operations Manual -> Seed a cluster].
====


[role=enterprise-edition]
[[administration-databases-alter-database]]
== Altering databases

Standard databases can be modified using the command `ALTER DATABASE`.

[[administration-databases-alter-database-access]]
=== Access

By default, a database has read-write access mode on creation.
The database can be limited to read-only mode on creation using the configuration parameters `dbms.databases.default_to_read_only`, `dbms.databases.read_only`, and `dbms.database.writable`.
For details, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/manage-databases/configuration#manage_database_parameters[Configuration parameters].

A database that was created with read-write access mode can be changed to read-only.
To change it to read-only, you can use the `ALTER DATABASE` command with the sub-clause `SET ACCESS READ ONLY`.
Subsequently, the database access mode can be switched back to read-write using the sub-clause `SET ACCESS READ WRITE`.
Altering the database access mode is allowed at all times, whether a database is online or offline.

If conflicting modes are set by the `ALTER DATABASE` command and the configuration parameters, i.e. one says read-write and the other read-only, the database will be read-only and prevent write queries.

[NOTE]
====
Modifying access mode is only available to standard databases and not composite databases.

.+DROP DATABASE+
======

This command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to fail with an error if the database does not exist.
Appending `IF EXISTS` to the command ensures that no error is returned and nothing happens should the database not exist.
It will always return an error, if there is an existing alias that targets the database. In that case, the alias needs to be dropped before dropping the database.

The `DROP DATABASE` command will remove a database entirely.

.+DROP DATABASE+
======

You can request that a dump of the store files is produced first, and stored in the path configured using the `dbms.directories.dumps.root` setting (by default `<neo4j-home>/data/dumps`).
This can be achieved by appending `DUMP DATA` to the command (or `DESTROY DATA` to explicitly request the default behavior).
These dumps are equivalent to those produced by `neo4j-admin dump` and can be similarly restored using `neo4j-admin load`.

The options `IF EXISTS` and  `DUMP DATA`/ `DESTROY DATA` can also be combined.
An example could look like this:

It is also possible to ensure that only composite databases are dropped. A `DROP COMPOSITE` request would then fail if the targeted database is a standard database.

To ensure the database to be dropped is standard and not composite, the user first needs to check the `type` column of `SHOW DATABASES` manually.

== Wait options

Aside from `SHOW DATABASES` and `ALTER DATABASE`, all database management commands accept an optional `WAIT`/`NOWAIT` clause.
The `WAIT`/`NOWAIT` clause allows you to specify a time limit in which the command must complete and return.

The options are:

* `WAIT n SECONDS` - Return once completed or when the specified time limit of `n` seconds is up.
* `WAIT` - Return once completed or when the default time limit of 300 seconds is up.
* `NOWAIT` - Return immediately.

A command using a `WAIT` clause will automatically commit the current transaction when it executes successfully, as the command needs to run immediately for it to be possible to `WAIT` for it to complete.
Any subsequent commands executed will therefore be performed in a new transaction.
This is different to the usual transactional behavior, and for this reason it is recommended that these commands be run in their own transaction.
The default behavior is `NOWAIT`, so if no clause is specified the transaction will behave normally and the action is performed in the background post-commit.

[NOTE]
====
A command with a `WAIT` clause may be interrupted whilst it is waiting to complete.
In this event the command will continue to execute in the background and will not be aborted.

|===

The `success` column provides an aggregate status of whether or not the command is considered successful and thus every row will have the same value.
The intention of this column is to make it easy to determine, for example in a script, whether or not the command completed successfully without timing out.

A command with a `WAIT` clause may be interrupted whilst it is waiting to complete.
In this event the command will continue to execute in the background and will not be aborted.
