_This feature was released in Neo4j 5.13._

This section explains how to use Cypher to manage load privileges.
All load privileges apply to the whole system.
Like DBMS privileges, they do not belong to one specific database or graph.
For more details on the differences between graphs, databases, and the DBMS, refer to xref::introduction/cypher_neo4j.adoc[].

// TODO: add image later when there is more than one LOAD privilege
//image::privileges_hierarchy_load.svg[title="Load privileges hierarchy"]

The load privileges apply to the xref:clauses/load-csv.adoc[`LOAD CSV` clause], deciding whether or not the data can be loaded from the given source.

The load privileges are assigned using Cypher administrative commands.
They can be granted, denied, and revoked in the same way as other privileges.
For more details, see xref:administration/access-control/manage-privileges.adoc[].

Unlike other privileges, the `LOAD` privilege is not granted, denied, or revoked on `DBMS`, `Database`, or `Graph`, but instead on the data source to load from.
Currently, only on `ALL DATA` meaning all sources.

[[access-control-load-all-data]]
== The `ALL DATA` privilege

The load privilege on `ALL DATA` enables or disables loading data.
If granted, the user can load data from any source.
If missing or denied, no data can be loaded at all.

For example, the below query grants users with the role `roleLoadAllData` the ability to load data with `LOAD CSV`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT LOAD ON ALL DATA TO roleLoadAllData
----

The below query lists all privileges for the role `roleLoadAllData` as commands:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE roleLoadAllData PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT LOAD ON ALL DATA TO `roleLoadAllData`"

The `LOAD ON ALL DATA` privilege is granted to the `PUBLIC` role by default.
