This section explains how to use Cypher to manage Neo4j DBMS administrative privileges.
--

All DBMS privileges are relevant system-wide.
Like user management, they do not belong to one specific database or graph.
For more details on the differences between graphs, databases and the DBMS, refer to xref::introduction/cypher_neo4j.adoc[].

image::privileges_grant_and_deny_syntax_dbms_privileges.svg[title="Syntax of GRANT and DENY DBMS Privileges"]

image::privileges_hierarchy_dbms.svg[title="DBMS privileges hierarchy"]

The xref::administration/access-control/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-admin[`admin` role] has a number of built-in privileges.
These include:

* Create, delete, and modify databases and aliases.
* Change configuration parameters.
* Manage transactions.
* Manage users and roles.
* Manage sub-graph privileges.
* Manage procedure security.

To enable a user to perform these tasks, you can grant them the `admin` role, but it is also possible to make a custom role with a subset of these privileges.
All privileges are also assignable using Cypher commands.
For more details, see the following sections:

* xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-role-management[Role management]
* xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-user-management[User management]

== Using a custom role to manage DBMS privileges

In order to have an administrator role with a subset of privileges that includes all DBMS privileges, but not all database privileges, you can copy the `admin` role and revoke or deny the unwanted privileges.
A second option is to build a custom administrator from scratch by granting the wanted privileges instead.

As an example, an administrator role can be created to only manage users and roles by using the second option:

. First, create the new role:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE ROLE usermanager
----
. Then grant the privilege to manage users:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT USER MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO usermanager
----
. And to manage roles:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ROLE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO usermanager
----

The resulting role has privileges that only allow user and role management.
To list all privileges for the role `usermanager` as commands, run this query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE usermanager PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT ROLE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `usermanager`"
|"GRANT USER MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `usermanager`"
a|Rows: 2
|===

Note that this role does not allow all DBMS capabilities.
For example, the role is missing privileges for management, creation and drop of databases as well as execution of `admin` procedures.
To create a more powerful administrator, you can grant a different set of privileges.

In the following example, a new administrator role is created to perform almost all DBMS capabilities, excluding database management.
However, the role still has some limited database capabilities, such as managing transactions:

. Again, start by creating a new role:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE ROLE customAdministrator
----
. Then grant the privilege for all DBMS capabilities:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ALL DBMS PRIVILEGES ON DBMS TO customAdministrator
----
. And explicitly deny the privilege to manage databases and aliases:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY DATABASE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO customAdministrator
----
. Next, grant the transaction management privilege:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT (*) ON DATABASE * TO customAdministrator
----

The resulting role has privileges that include all DBMS privileges except creating, dropping, and modifying databases and aliases, as well as managing transactions.
Use the following query to list all privileges for the role `customAdministrator` as commands:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE customAdministrator PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"DENY DATABASE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `customAdministrator`"
|"GRANT ALL DBMS PRIVILEGES ON DBMS TO `customAdministrator`"
|"GRANT TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT (*) ON DATABASE * TO `customAdministrator`"
a|Rows: 3
|===

[[access-control-dbms-administration-impersonation]]
== The DBMS `IMPERSONATE` privileges

The DBMS privileges for impersonation can be assigned through Cypher administrative commands.
They can be granted, denied, and revoked like other privileges.

Impersonation is the ability of a user to assume another user's roles (and therefore privileges), with the restriction of not being able to execute updating `admin` commands as the impersonated user (i.e. they would still be able to use `SHOW` commands).

The ability to impersonate users can be granted via the `IMPERSONATE` privilege.

[NOTE]
====
More details about the syntax descriptions can be found xref:administration/index.adoc#administration-syntax[here].
====

.Impersonation privileges command syntax
[options="header", width="100%", cols="3a,2"]
|===
| Command | Description

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] IMPERSONATE [(*)]
    ON DBMS
    TO role[, ...]
| Enables the specified roles to impersonate any user.

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] IMPERSONATE (user[, ...])
    ON DBMS
    TO role[, ...]
| Enables the specified roles to impersonate the specified users.

|===

The following query shows an example of this.
Note that `userImpersonator` must be an existing role in order to make this query work:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT IMPERSONATE (*) ON DBMS TO userImpersonator
----

The resulting role has privileges that allow impersonating all users:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE userImpersonator PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
| command
| "GRANT IMPERSONATE (*) ON DBMS TO `userImpersonator`"
a|Rows: 1
|===

It is also possible to deny and revoke that privilege.
See an example which shows of how the `userImpersonator` user would be able to impersonate all users, except `alice`:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY IMPERSONATE (alice) ON DBMS TO userImpersonator
----

To grant (or revoke) the permissions to impersonate a specific user or a subset of users, you can first list them with this query:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT IMPERSONATE (alice, bob) ON DBMS TO userImpersonator
----


[[access-control-dbms-administration-database-management]]
== The DBMS `DATABASE MANAGEMENT` privileges

[options="header", width="100%", cols="3a,2"]
|===
| Command
| Description

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] EXECUTE PROCEDURE[S] name-globbing[, ...]
  ON DBMS
  TO role[, ...]
| Enables the specified roles to execute the given procedures.

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE[S] name-globbing[, ...]
  ON DBMS
  TO role[, ...]
| Enables the specified roles to execute the given procedures with elevated privileges.

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] EXECUTE ADMIN[ISTRATOR] PROCEDURES
  ON DBMS
  TO role[, ...]
| Enables the specified roles to execute procedures annotated with `@Admin`. The procedures are executed with elevated privileges.

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] EXECUTE [USER [DEFINED]] FUNCTION[S] name-globbing[, ...]
  ON DBMS

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] EXECUTE BOOSTED [USER [DEFINED]] FUNCTION[S] name-globbing[, ...]
  ON DBMS
  TO role[, ...]
| Enables the specified roles to execute the given user defined functions with elevated privileges.
|===

The `EXECUTE BOOSTED` privileges replace the `dbms.security.procedures.default_allowed` and `dbms.security.procedures.roles` configuration parameters for procedures and user defined functions.
The configuration parameters are still honored as a set of temporary privileges.
These cannot be revoked, but will be updated on each restart with the current configuration values.


[[access-control-execute-procedure]]
=== The `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` privilege

The ability to execute a procedure can be granted via the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` privilege.
A role with this privilege is allowed to execute the procedures matched by the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing].
The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE db.schema.* ON DBMS TO procedureExecutor
----

Users with the role `procedureExecutor` can then run any procedure in the `db.schema` namespace.
The procedure is run using the user's own privileges.

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing procedures in the `db.schema` namespace.
List all privileges for the role `procedureExecutor` as commands by using the following query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE procedureExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE db.schema.* ON DBMS TO `procedureExecutor`"
a|Rows: 1
|===

In order to allow the execution of all but only a few procedures, you can grant `EXECUTE PROCEDURES *` and deny the unwanted procedures.
For example, the following queries allow the execution of all procedures, except those starting with `dbms.killTransaction`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO deniedProcedureExecutor
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY EXECUTE PROCEDURE dbms.killTransaction* ON DBMS TO deniedProcedureExecutor
----

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing all procedures except those starting with `dbms.killTransaction`.
List all privileges for the role `deniedProcedureExecutor` as commands by using the following query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE deniedProcedureExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"DENY EXECUTE PROCEDURE dbms.killTransaction* ON DBMS TO `deniedProcedureExecutor`"
|"GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO `deniedProcedureExecutor`"
a|Rows: 2
|===

Both the `dbms.killTransaction` and the `dbms.killTransactions` procedures are blocked here, as well as any other procedures starting with `dbms.killTransaction`.


[[access-control-execute-boosted-procedure]]
=== The `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege

The ability to execute a procedure with elevated privileges can be granted via the `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege.
A user with this privilege is allowed to execute the procedures matched by the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing] without the execution being restricted to their other privileges.

There is no need to grant an individual `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` privilege for the procedures either, as granting the `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` includes an implicit `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` grant for them.
A denied `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` still denies executing the procedure.
The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO boostedProcedureExecutor;
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.labels, db.relationshipTypes ON DBMS TO boostedProcedureExecutor
----

Users with the role `boostedProcedureExecutor` can thus run the `db.labels` and the `db.relationshipTypes` procedures with full privileges.
Now they can see everything on the graph and not just the labels and types that the user has `TRAVERSE` privilege on.

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing the `db.labels` and the `db.relationshipTypes` procedures, but with elevated execution.
List all privileges for the role `boostedProcedureExecutor` as commands by using the following query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE boostedProcedureExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO `boostedProcedureExecutor`"
|"GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.labels ON DBMS TO `boostedProcedureExecutor`"
|"GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.relationshipTypes ON DBMS TO `boostedProcedureExecutor`"
a|Rows: 3
|===

Granting the `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege on its own allows the procedure to be both executed (due to the implicit `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` grant) and proceed with elevated privileges.
A denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` on its own behaves slightly differently: it only denies the elevation and not the execution of the procedure.
However, a role with both a granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` and a denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` will deny the execution as well.
This is explained through the following examples:

.Grant `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` and deny `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE`
[example]
====
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO deniedBoostedProcedureExecutor1
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE db.labels ON DBMS TO deniedBoostedProcedureExecutor1
----

The resulting role has privileges that allow the execution of all procedures using the user's own privileges.
It also prevents the `db.labels` procedure from being elevated.
Still, the denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` does not block execution of `db.labels`.

To list all privileges for role `deniedBoostedProcedureExecutor1` as commands, use the following query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE deniedBoostedProcedureExecutor1 PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS

.How would the privileges from examples 1 to 4 affect the output of a procedure?
[example]
====
Assume there is a procedure called `myProc`.

This procedure gives the result `A` and `B` for a user with `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` privilege and `A`, `B` and `C` for a user with `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege.

Now, adapt the privileges from examples 1 to 4 to be applied to this procedure and show what is returned.
With the privileges from example 1, granted `EXECUTE PROCEDURE *` and denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`, the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A` and `B`.

With the privileges from example 2, granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE *` and denied `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc`, execution of the `myProc` procedure is not allowed.

With the privileges from example 3, granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE *` and denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`, execution of the `myProc` procedure is not allowed.

For comparison, when granted:

* `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc`: the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A` and `B`.
* `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`: execution of the `myProc` procedure is not allowed.
* `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc` and `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc`: the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A`, `B`, and `C`.

For comparison, when only `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc` is granted, the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A`, `B`, and `C`; without the need for granting of the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc` privilege.
====


[[access-control-admin-procedure]]
=== The `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURE` privilege

The ability to execute admin procedures (annotated with `@Admin`) can be granted via the `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES` privilege.
This privilege is equivalent to granting the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-execute-boosted-procedure[`EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege] on each of the admin procedures.
Any newly added `admin` procedure is automatically included in this privilege.
The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES ON DBMS TO adminProcedureExecutor
----

Users with the role `adminProcedureExecutor` can then run any `admin` procedure with elevated privileges.

The resulting role has privileges that allow executing all admin procedures.
List all privileges for the role `adminProcedureExecutor` as commands by using the following query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE adminProcedureExecutor PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES ON DBMS TO `adminProcedureExecutor`"
a|Rows: 1
|===

In order to compare this with the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` and `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privileges, revisit the `myProc` procedure, but this time as an `admin` procedure, which will give the result `A`, `B` and `C` when allowed to execute.

By starting with a user only granted with the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE myProc` privilege, execution of the `myProc` procedure is not allowed.

However, for a user granted with the `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE myProc` or `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES` privileges, the `myProc` procedure returns the result `A`, `B` and `C`.

Any denied `EXECUTE` privilege results in the procedure not being allowed to be executed.
In this case, it does not matter whether `EXECUTE PROCEDURE`, `EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` or `EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES` is being denied.


[[access-control-execute-user-defined-function]]
=== The `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege

//EXECUTE [USER [DEFINED]] FUNCTION[S]
The ability to execute a user-defined function (UDF) can be granted via the `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege.
A role with this privilege is allowed to execute the UDFs matched by the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege does not apply to built-in functions, which are always executable.
====

.Execute user-defined function
======
The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION apoc.coll.* ON DBMS TO functionExecutor
----

Or in short form:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTION apoc.coll.* ON DBMS TO functionExecutor
----

Users with the role `functionExecutor` can thus run any UDF in the `apoc.coll` namespace.
The function here is run using the user's own privileges.

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing UDFs in the `apoc.coll` namespace.
List all privileges for the role `functionExecutor` as commands by using the following query:

[[access-control-execute-boosted-user-defined-function]]
=== The `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege

//EXECUTE BOOSTED [USER [DEFINED]] FUNCTION[S]
The ability to execute a user-defined function (UDF) with elevated privileges can be granted via the `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege.
A user with this privilege is allowed to execute the UDFs matched by the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing] without the execution being restricted to their other privileges.

There is no need to grant an individual `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege for the functions, as granting `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` includes an implicit `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` grant.
However, a denied `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` still prevents the function to be executed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege does not apply to built-in functions, as they have no concept of elevated privileges.
====

Granting `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` on its own allows the UDF to be both executed (because of the implicit `EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION` grant) and gives it elevated privileges during the execution.
A denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` on its own behaves slightly differently: it only denies the elevation and not the execution of the UDF.
However, a role with only a granted `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` and a denied `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` prevents the execution to be performed as well.
This is the same behavior as for the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-execute-boosted-procedure[`EXECUTE BOOSTED PROCEDURE` privilege].

.Execute boosted user-defined function
======
The following query shows an example of how to grant the `EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION` privilege:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTION * ON DBMS TO boostedFunctionExecutor
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED USER DEFINED FUNCTION apoc.any.properties ON DBMS TO boostedFunctionExecutor
----

Or in short form:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTION * ON DBMS TO boostedFunctionExecutor
GRANT EXECUTE BOOSTED FUNCTION apoc.any.properties ON DBMS TO boostedFunctionExecutor
----

Users with the role `boostedFunctionExecutor` can thus run `apoc.any.properties` with full privileges and see every property on the node/relationship, not just the properties that the user has `READ` privilege on.

The resulting role has privileges that only allow executing of the UDF `apoc.any.properties`, but with elevated execution.
List all privileges for the role `boostedFunctionExecutor` as commands by using the following query:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----

[[access-control-dbms-administration-setting]]
== The DBMS `SETTING` privileges

_This feature was introduced in Neo4j 5.6._

The ability to show configuration settings can be granted via the `SHOW SETTING` privilege.
A role with this privilege is allowed to query the configuration settings matched by the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-name-globbing[name-globbing].

| Description

| [source, syntax, role=noheader]
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] SHOW SETTING[S] name-globbing[, ...]
  ON DBMS
  TO role[, ...]
| Enables the specified roles to query given configuration settings.
|===

The following query shows an example of how to grant this privilege:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT SHOW SETTING server.bolt.* ON DBMS TO configurationViewer
----

Users with the role `configurationViewer` can then query any setting in the `server.bolt` namespace.

The updated role `configurationViewer` has privileges that only allow querying settings in the `server.bolt` namespace.
List all privileges for the role `configurationViewer` as commands by using the following query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE configurationViewer PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT SHOW SETTING server.bolt.* ON DBMS TO `configurationViewer`"
a|Rows: 1
|===

To deny a specific setting from a role, first grant `SHOW SETTINGS *`, and then deny the unwanted setting.
For example, the following queries allow the querying of all settings, except those starting with `dbms.security`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT SHOW SETTINGS * ON DBMS TO deniedConfigurationViewer
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY SHOW SETTING dbms.security* ON DBMS TO deniedConfigurationViewer
----

The resulting role has privileges that allow querying all settings except those starting with `dbms.security`.
List all privileges for the role `deniedConfigurationViewer` as commands by using the following query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE deniedConfigurationViewer PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"DENY SHOW SETTING dbms.security* ON DBMS TO `deniedConfigurationViewer`"
|"GRANT SHOW SETTING * ON DBMS TO `deniedConfigurationViewer`"
a|Rows: 2
|===

As the query result shows, access to any setting starting with `dbms.security` are blocked, but the rest can still be queried.

[[access-control-name-globbing]]
== Name-globbing for procedures, user-defined functions, and settings

The name-globbing for procedure, user defined function, and setting names is a simplified version of globbing for filename expansions.
It only allows two wildcard characters: `+*+` and `?`, which are used for multiple and single character matches.
In this case, `+*+` means 0 or more characters and `?` matches exactly one character.

[NOTE]
====
The name-globbing is subject to the xref::syntax/naming.adoc[standard Cypher restrictions on valid identifiers],
with the exception that it may include dots, stars, and question marks without the need for escaping using backticks.

Each part of the name-globbing separated by dots may be individually escaped.
For example, `++mine.`procedureWith%`++` is allowed, but not `++mine.procedure`With%`++`.
Also, note that wildcard characters behave as wildcards even when escaped.
For example, using `++`*`++` is equivalent to using `+*+`, and thus allows executing all functions or procedures and not only the procedure or function named `+*+`.
====

Given the following list of procedures:

* `mine.public.exampleProcedure`
* `mine.public.exampleProcedure1`
* `mine.public.exampleProcedure2`
* `mine.public.with#Special§Characters`
* `mine.private.exampleProcedure`
* `mine.private.exampleProcedure1`
* `mine.private.exampleProcedure2`
* `mine.private.with#Special§Characters`
* `your.exampleProcedure`

The following examples demonstrate how name-globbing patterns can be used in controlling access to procedures.
Note that the same rules apply to user-defined functions and settings.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO globbing1
----

Users with the role `globbing1` can run all the procedures.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE mine.*.exampleProcedure ON DBMS TO globbing2
----

Users with the role `globbing2` can run procedures `mine.public.exampleProcedure` and `mine.private.exampleProcedure`, but no other procedures.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE mine.*.exampleProcedure? ON DBMS TO globbing3
----

Users with the role `globbing3` can run procedures `mine.public.exampleProcedure1`, `mine.private.exampleProcedure1`, and `mine.private.exampleProcedure2`, but no other procedures.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE *.exampleProcedure ON DBMS TO globbing4
----

Users with the role `globbing4` can run procedures `your.exampleProcedure`, `mine.public.exampleProcedure`, and `mine.private.exampleProcedure`, but no other procedures.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE mine.public.exampleProcedure* ON DBMS TO globbing5
----

Users with the role `globbing5` can run procedures `mine.public.exampleProcedure`, `mine.public.exampleProcedure1` and `mine.public.exampleProcedure42`, but no other procedures.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE `mine.public.with#*§Characters`, mine.private.`with#Spec???§Characters` ON DBMS TO globbing6
----

Users with the role `globbing6` can run procedures `mine.public.with#Special§Characters`, and `mine.private.with#Special§Characters`, but no other procedures.

[NOTE]
====
The name-globbing may be fully or partially escaped.
Both `+*+` and `+?+` are interpreted as wildcards in both cases.
