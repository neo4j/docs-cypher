[[query-merge-introduction]]
== Introduction

`MERGE` either matches existing nodes and binds them, or it creates new data and binds that.
It's like a combination of `MATCH` and `CREATE` that additionally allows you to specify what happens if the data was matched or created.

For example, you can specify that the graph must contain a node for a user with a certain name.
If there isn't a node with the correct name, a new node will be created and its name property set.

[NOTE]
====
For performance reasons, creating a schema index on the label or property is highly recommended when using `MERGE`.
See xref::indexes-for-search-performance.adoc[] for more information.
====

When using `MERGE` on full patterns, the behavior is that either the whole pattern matches, or the whole pattern is created.
`MERGE` will not partially use existing patterns -- it is all or nothing.
If partial matches are needed, this can be accomplished by splitting a pattern up into multiple `MERGE` clauses.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Under concurrent updates, `MERGE` only guarantees existence of the `MERGE` pattern, but not uniqueness.
To guarantee uniqueness of nodes with certain properties, a xref::constraints/index.adoc[unique constraint] should be used.
See xref::clauses/merge.adoc#query-merge-using-unique-constraints[Using unique constraints with `MERGE`] to see how `MERGE` can be used in combination with a unique constraint.
====

As with `MATCH`, `MERGE` can match multiple occurrences of a pattern.
If there are multiple matches, they will all be passed on to later stages of the query.

The last part of `MERGE` is the `ON CREATE` and `ON MATCH`.
These allow a query to express additional changes to the properties of a node or relationship, depending on if the element was matched (`MATCH`) in the database or if it was created (`CREATE`).

The following graph is used for the examples below:

////
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (person:Person) REQUIRE person.name IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (movie:Movie) REQUIRE movie.title IS UNIQUE;
CREATE

[[query-merge-node-derived]]
== Merge nodes

[[merge-merge-single-node-with-a-label]]
=== Merge single node with a label

Merging a single node with the given label.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MERGE (robert:Critic)
RETURN robert, labels(robert)
----

A new node is created because there are no nodes labeled `Critic` in the database.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| +robert+ | +labels(robert)+
| +Node[7]{}+ | +["Critic"]+
2+d|Rows: 1 +
Nodes created: 1 +
Labels added: 1
|===


[[merge-merge-single-node-with-properties]]
=== Merge single node with properties

Merging a single node with properties where not all properties match any existing node.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MERGE (charlie {name: 'Charlie Sheen', age: 10})
RETURN charlie
----

A new node with the name `Charlie Sheen` is created since not all properties matched those set to the pre-existing `Charlie Sheen` node:

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +charlie+
| +Node[7]{age:10,name:"Charlie Sheen"}+
1+d|Rows: 1 +
Nodes created: 1 +
Properties set: 2
|===


[NOTE]
====
`MERGE` cannot be used for nodes with property values that are `null`.
For example, the following query will throw an error:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-fail]
----
MERGE (martin:Person {name: 'Martin Sheen', age: null})
RETURN martin
----

[source, error]
----
Cannot merge the following node because of null property value for 'age': (:Person {age: null})
----
====

[[merge-merge-single-node-specifying-both-label-and-property]]
=== Merge single node specifying both label and property

Merging a single node with both label and property matching an existing node.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MERGE (michael:Person {name: 'Michael Douglas'})
RETURN michael.name, michael.bornIn
----

`Michael Douglas` is matched and the `name` and `bornIn` properties are returned:

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| +michael.name+ | +michael.bornIn+
| +"Michael Douglas"+ | +"New Jersey"+
2+d|Rows: 1
|===

As mentioned previously, `MERGE` queries can greatly benefit from schema indexes.
In this example, the following would significantly improve the performance of the `MERGE` clause:

.Query
[source, cypher, role="noheader"]
----
CREATE INDEX PersonIndex FOR (n:Person) ON (n.name)
----


[[merge-merge-single-node-derived-from-an-existing-node-property]]
=== Merge single node derived from an existing node property

For some property `p` in each bound node in a set of nodes, a single new node is created for each unique value for `p`.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
MERGE (city:City {name: person.bornIn})
RETURN person.name, person.bornIn, city
----

In the above query, three nodes labeled `Location` are created, each of which contains a `name` property with the value of `New York`, `Ohio`, and `New Jersey` respectively.
Note that even though the `MATCH` clause results in three bound nodes having the value `New York` for the `bornIn` property, only a single `New York` node (i.e. a `Location` node with a name of `New York`) is created.
As the `New York` node is not matched for the first bound node, it is created.
However, the newly-created `New York` node is matched and bound for the second and third bound nodes.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="3*<m"]
|===
| +person.name+ | +person.bornIn+ | +city+
| +"Charlie Sheen"+ | +"New York"+ | +Node[7]{name:"New York"}+
| +"Martin Sheen"+ | +"Ohio"+ | +Node[8]{name:"Ohio"}+
| +"Michael Douglas"+ | +"New Jersey"+ | +Node[9]{name:"New Jersey"}+
| +"Oliver Stone"+ | +"New York"+ | +Node[7]{name:"New York"}+
| +"Rob Reiner"+ | +"New York"+ | +Node[7]{name:"New York"}+
3+d|Rows: 5 +
Nodes created: 3 +
Properties set: 3 +
Labels added: 3
|===

[[query-merge-on-create-on-match]]
== Use `ON CREATE` and `ON MATCH`

[[merge-merge-with-on-create]]
=== Merge with `ON CREATE`

Merge a node and set properties if the node needs to be created.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MERGE (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
ON CREATE
  SET keanu.created = timestamp()
RETURN keanu.name, keanu.created
----

The query creates the `'keanu'` node and sets a timestamp on creation time.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| +keanu.name+ | +keanu.created+
| +"Keanu Reeves"+ | +1655200898563+
2+d|Rows: 1 +
Nodes created: 1 +

[[merge-merge-with-on-match]]
=== Merge with `ON MATCH`

Merging nodes and setting properties on found nodes.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MERGE (person:Person)
ON MATCH
  SET person.found = true
RETURN person.name, person.found
----

The query finds all the `Person` nodes, sets a property on them, and returns them.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| +person.name+ | +person.found+
| +"Charlie Sheen"+ | +true+
| +"Martin Sheen"+ | +true+

MERGE (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
ON CREATE
  SET keanu.created = timestamp()
ON MATCH
  SET keanu.lastSeen = timestamp()
RETURN keanu.name, keanu.created, keanu.lastSeen
----

The query creates the `'keanu'` node, and sets a timestamp on creation time.
If `'keanu'` had already existed, a different property would have been set.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="3*<m"]
|===
| +keanu.name+ | +keanu.created+ | +keanu.lastSeen+

[[merge-merge-with-on-match-setting-multiple-properties]]
=== Merge with `ON MATCH` setting multiple properties

If multiple properties should be set, simply separate them with commas.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MERGE (person:Person)
ON MATCH
  SET
    person.found = true,
    person.lastAccessed = timestamp()

3+d|Rows: 5 +
Properties set: 10

[[query-merge-relationships]]
== Merge relationships

[[merge-merge-on-a-relationship]]
=== Merge on a relationship

`MERGE` can be used to match or create a relationship.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH
  (charlie:Person {name: 'Charlie Sheen'}),
  (wallStreet:Movie {title: 'Wall Street'})
MERGE (charlie)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(wallStreet)
RETURN charlie.name, type(r), wallStreet.title
----

`Charlie Sheen` had already been marked as acting in `Wall Street`, so the existing relationship is found and returned.
Note that in order to match or create a relationship when using `MERGE`, at least one bound node must be specified, which is done via the `MATCH` clause in the above example.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="3*<m"]
|===
| +charlie.name+ | +type(r)+ | +wallStreet.title+
| +"Charlie Sheen"+ | +"ACTED_IN"+ | +"Wall Street"+
3+d|Rows: 1
|===

[NOTE]
====
`MERGE` cannot be used for relationships with property values that are `null`.
For example, the following query will throw an error:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-fail]
----
MERGE (martin:Person {name: 'Martin Sheen'})-[r:FATHER_OF {since: null}]->(charlie:Person {name: 'Charlie Sheen'})
RETURN type(r)
----

[source, error]
----
Cannot merge the following relationship because of null property value for 'since': (martin)-[:FATHER_OF {since: null}]->(charlie)
----
====

[[merge-merge-on-multiple-relationships]]
=== Merge on multiple relationships

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH
  (oliver:Person {name: 'Oliver Stone'}),
  (reiner:Person {name: 'Rob Reiner'})
MERGE (oliver)-[:DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(reiner)
RETURN movie
----

In the example graph, `Oliver Stone` and `Rob Reiner` have never worked together.
When trying to `MERGE` a `Movie` node between them, Neo4j will not use any of the existing `Movie` nodes already connected to either person.
Instead, a new `Movie` node is created.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +movie+
| +Node[7]{}+
1+d|Rows: 1 +
Nodes created: 1 +
Relationships created: 2 +
Labels added: 1
|===


[[merge-merge-on-an-undirected-relationship]]
=== Merge on an undirected relationship

`MERGE` can also be used with an undirected relationship.
When it needs to create a new one, it will pick a direction.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH
  (charlie:Person {name: 'Charlie Sheen'}),
  (oliver:Person {name: 'Oliver Stone'})
MERGE (charlie)-[r:KNOWS]-(oliver)
RETURN r
----

As `Charlie Sheen` and `Oliver Stone` do not know each other in the example graph, this `MERGE` query will create a `KNOWS` relationship between them.
The direction of the created relationship is left to right.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| +r+
| +:KNOWS[8]{}+
1+d|Rows: 1 +
Relationships created: 1
|===


[[merge-merge-on-a-relationship-between-two-existing-nodes]]
=== Merge on a relationship between two existing nodes

`MERGE` can be used in conjunction with preceding `MATCH` and `MERGE` clauses to create a relationship between two bound nodes `m` and `n`, where `m` is returned by `MATCH` and `n` is created or matched by the earlier `MERGE`.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
MERGE (city:City {name: person.bornIn})
MERGE (person)-[r:BORN_IN]->(city)
RETURN person.name, person.bornIn, city
----

This builds on the example from xref::clauses/merge.adoc#merge-merge-single-node-derived-from-an-existing-node-property[Merge single node derived from an existing node property].
The second `MERGE` creates a `BORN_IN` relationship between each person and a location corresponding to the value of the person’s `bornIn` property.
`Charlie Sheen`, `Rob Reiner`, and `Oliver Stone` all have a `BORN_IN` relationship to the _same_ `Location` node (`New York`).

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="3*<m"]
|===

[[merge-merge-on-a-relationship-between-an-existing-node-and-a-merged-node-derived-from-a-node-property]]
=== Merge on a relationship between an existing node and a merged node derived from a node property

`MERGE` can be used to simultaneously create both a new node `n` and a relationship between a bound node `m` and `n`.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (person:Person)
MERGE (person)-[r:HAS_CHAUFFEUR]->(chauffeur:Chauffeur {name: person.chauffeurName})
RETURN person.name, person.chauffeurName, chauffeur
----

As `MERGE` found no matches -- in our example graph, there are no nodes labeled with `Chauffeur` and no `HAS_CHAUFFEUR` relationships -- `MERGE` creates five nodes labeled with `Chauffeur`, each of which contains a `name` property whose value corresponds to each matched `Person` node's `chauffeurName` property value.
`MERGE` also creates a `HAS_CHAUFFEUR` relationship between each `Person` node and the newly-created corresponding `Chauffeur` node.
As `'Charlie Sheen'` and `'Michael Douglas'` both have a chauffeur with the same name -- `'John Brown'` -- a new node is created in each case, resulting in _two_ `Chauffeur` nodes having a `name` of `'John Brown'`, correctly denoting the fact that even though the `name` property may be identical, these are two separate people.
This is in contrast to the example shown above in xref::clauses/merge.adoc#merge-merge-on-a-relationship-between-two-existing-nodes[Merge on a relationship between two existing nodes], where we used the first `MERGE` to bind the `City` nodes to prevent them from being recreated (and thus duplicated) in the second `MERGE`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="3*<m"]
|===
| +person.name+ | +person.chauffeurName+ | +chauffeur+

[[query-merge-using-unique-constraints]]
== Using unique constraints with `MERGE`

Cypher prevents getting conflicting results from `MERGE` when using patterns that involve unique constraints.
In this case, there must be at most one node that matches that pattern.

For example, given two unique constraints on `:Person(id)` and `:Person(ssn)`, a query such as `MERGE (n:Person {id: 12, ssn: 437})` will fail, if there are two different nodes (one with `id` 12 and one with `ssn` 437) or if there is only one node with only one of the properties.
In other words, there must be exactly one node that matches the pattern, or no matching nodes.

Note that the following examples assume the existence of unique constraints that have been created using:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (n:Person) REQUIRE n.name IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (n:Person) REQUIRE n.role IS UNIQUE;
----


[[merge-merge-using-unique-constraints-creates-a-new-node-if-no-node-is-found]]

MERGE (laurence:Person {name: 'Laurence Fishburne'})
RETURN laurence.name

[[merge-merge-with-unique-constraints-and-partial-matches]]
=== Merge with unique constraints and partial matches

Merge using unique constraints fails when finding partial matches.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MERGE (michael:Person {name: 'Michael Douglas', role: 'Gordon Gekko'})
RETURN michael
----

While there is a matching unique `Person` node with the name `Michael Douglas`, there is no unique node with the role of `Gordon Gekko` and `MERGE`, therefore, fails to match.

.Error message
[source]
----
Merge did not find a matching node michael and can not create a new node due to
