:description: This section explains the `SHOW SETTINGS` command.

= SHOW SETTINGS

_This feature was introduced in Neo4j 5.6._

Listing the configuration settings on a server can be done with `SHOW SETTINGS`.

[NOTE]
====
The command `SHOW SETTINGS` returns settings on the executing server only.
To retrieve settings on a specific server, you need to directly connect to it using `bolt` scheme.
====

[NOTE]
====
The command `SHOW SETTINGS` returns only the default output.
For a full output use the optional `YIELD` command.
Full output: `SHOW SETTINGS YIELD *`.
====

The `SHOW SETTINGS` command will produce a table with the following columns:


.Show settings output
[options="header", cols="4,6,2"]
|===
| Column | Description | Type

m| name
a| The name of the setting. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| value
a| The current value of the setting. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| isDynamic
a|
Whether the value of the setting can be updated dynamically, without restarting the server.
For dynamically updating a setting value, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/dynamic-settings/[Update dynamic settings].
label:default-output[]
m| BOOLEAN

m| defaultValue
a| The default value of the setting. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| description
a| The setting description. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| startupValue
a| The value of the setting at last startup.
m| STRING

m| isExplicitlySet
a| Whether the value of the setting is explicitly set by the user, either through configuration or dynamically.
m| BOOLEAN

m| validValues
a| A description of valid values for the setting.
m| STRING

m| isDeprecated
a| Whether the setting is deprecated.
label:new[Introduced in 5.9]
m| BOOLEAN

== Syntax

[NOTE]
====
More details about the syntax descriptions can be found link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/database-administration/syntax/#administration-syntax-reading[here].
====

List settings::

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
SHOW SETTING[S] [setting-name[,...]]
[YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
[WHERE expression]
[RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

Setting names must be supplied as one or more comma-separated quoted `STRING` values or as an expression resolving to a `STRING` or a `LIST<STRING>`.

[NOTE]
====
When using the `RETURN` clause, the `YIELD` clause is mandatory and must not be omitted.
====

== Listing all settings

To list all settings with the default output columns, the `SHOW SETTINGS` command can be used.
If all columns are required, use `SHOW SETTINGS YIELD *`.

The Neo4j Enterprise Edition provides two alternative policies: The first is the 'continuous' check-point policy, which will ignore those settings and run the check-point process all the time. The second is the 'volumetric' check-point policy, which makes a best-effort at check-pointing often enough so that the database doesn't get too far behind on deleting old transaction logs in accordance with the 'db.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy' setting."

The database will not check-point more often than this (unless check pointing is triggered by a different event), but might check-point less often than this interval, if performing a check-point takes longer time than the configured interval. A check-point is a point in the transaction logs, which recovery would start from. Longer check-point intervals typically mean that recovery will take longer to complete in case of a crash. On the other hand, a longer check-point interval can also reduce the I/O load that the database places on the system, as each check-point implies a flushing and forcing of all the store files."

The above table only displays the first 10 results of the query.

== Listing settings with filtering on output columns

The listed settings can be filtered by using the `WHERE` clause.
For example, the following query returns the name, value, and description of all settings starting with 'dbms':

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
SHOW SETTINGS YIELD name, value, description
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'dbms'
RETURN name, value, description
LIMIT 10
