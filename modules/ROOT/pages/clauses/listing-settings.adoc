This section explains the `SHOW SETTINGS` command.
--

Listing the configuration settings on a server can be done with `SHOW SETTINGS`.

[NOTE]
====
The command `SHOW SETTINGS` returns settings on the executing server only.
To retrieve settings on a specific server, you need to directly connect to it using `bolt` scheme.
====

[NOTE]
====
The command `SHOW SETTINGS` returns only the default output.
For a full output use the optional `YIELD` command.
Full output: `SHOW SETTINGS YIELD *`.
====

The `SHOW SETTINGS` command will produce a table with the following columns:


.Show settings output
[options="header", cols="4,6"]
|===
| Column | Description

m| name
a| The name of the setting. label:default-output[]

m| value
a| The current value of the setting. label:default-output[]

m| isDynamic
a| 
Whether the value of the setting can be updated dynamically, without restarting the server.
For dynamically updating a setting value, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/dynamic-settings/[Update dynamic settings].
label:default-output[]

m| defaultValue
a| The default value of the setting. label:default-output[]

m| description
a| The setting description. label:default-output[]

m| startupValue
a| The value of the setting at last startup.

m| isExplicitlySet
a| Whether the value of the setting is explicitly set by the user, either through configuration or dynamically.

m| validValues
a| A description of valid values for the setting.

|===


== Syntax

[NOTE]
====
The syntax descriptions use xref:access-control/index.adoc#access-control-syntax[the style] from access control.
====

List settings::

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
SHOW SETTING[S] [setting-name[,...]]
[YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
[WHERE expression]
[RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

Setting names must be supplied as one or more comma-separated quoted strings or as an expression resolving to a string or a list of strings.

[NOTE]
====
When using the `RETURN` clause, the `YIELD` clause is mandatory and must not be omitted.
====

== Listing all settings

To list all settings with the default output columns, the `SHOW SETTINGS` command can be used.
If all columns are required, use `SHOW SETTINGS YIELD *`.

The above table only displays the first 10 results of the query.

== Listing settings with filtering on output columns

The listed settings can be filtered by using the `WHERE` clause.
For example, getting the name, value and description of all settings starting with 'dbms':

.Query

----
SHOW SETTINGS YIELD name, value, description
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'dbms'
RETURN name, value, description
LIMIT 10

| +"8"+
| +"The maximum number of TCP channels between two nodes to operate the raft protocol. Each database gets allocated one channel, but a single channel can be used by more than one database."+

== Listing specific settings

It is possible to specify which settings to return in the list by setting names.
