:page-role: not-on-aura new-5.6
:description: This section explains the `SHOW SETTINGS` command.

Listing the configuration settings on a server can be done with `SHOW SETTINGS`.

[NOTE]
====
The command `SHOW SETTINGS` returns settings on the executing server only.
To retrieve settings on a specific server, you need to directly connect to it using `bolt` scheme.
====

[NOTE]
====
The command `SHOW SETTINGS` returns only the default output.
For a full output use the optional `YIELD` command.
Full output: `SHOW SETTINGS YIELD *`.
====

The `SHOW SETTINGS` command will produce a table with the following columns:


.Show settings output
[options="header", cols="4,6,2"]
|===
| Column | Description | Type

m| name
a| The name of the setting. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| value
a| The current value of the setting. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| isDynamic
a|
Whether the value of the setting can be updated dynamically, without restarting the server.
For dynamically updating a setting value, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/dynamic-settings/[Update dynamic settings].
label:default-output[]
m| BOOLEAN

m| defaultValue
a| The default value of the setting. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| description
a| The setting description. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| startupValue
a| The value of the setting at last startup.
m| STRING

m| isExplicitlySet
a| Whether the value of the setting is explicitly set by the user, either through configuration or dynamically.
m| BOOLEAN

m| validValues
a| A description of valid values for the setting.
m| STRING

m| isDeprecated
a| Whether the setting is deprecated.
label:new[Introduced in 5.9]
m| BOOLEAN

== Syntax

[NOTE]
====
More details about the syntax descriptions can be found link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/database-administration/syntax/#administration-syntax-reading[here].
====

List settings::

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
SHOW SETTING[S] [setting-name[,...]]
[YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
[WHERE expression]
[RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

Setting names must be supplied as one or more comma-separated quoted `STRING` values or as an expression resolving to a `STRING` or a `LIST<STRING>`.

[NOTE]
====
When using the `RETURN` clause, the `YIELD` clause is mandatory and must not be omitted.
====

== Listing all settings

To list all settings with the default output columns, the `SHOW SETTINGS` command can be used.
If all columns are required, use `SHOW SETTINGS YIELD *`.

The Neo4j Enterprise Edition provides two alternative policies: The first is the 'continuous' check-point policy, which will ignore those settings and run the check-point process all the time. The second is the 'volumetric' check-point policy, which makes a best-effort at check-pointing often enough so that the database doesn't get too far behind on deleting old transaction logs in accordance with the 'db.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy' setting."

A check-point is a point in the transaction logs, which recovery would start from. Longer check-point intervals typically mean that recovery will take longer to complete in case of a crash. On the other hand, a longer check-point interval can also reduce the I/O load that the database places on the system, as each check-point implies a flushing and forcing of all the store files."

The above table only displays the first 10 results of the query.

== Listing settings with filtering on output columns

The listed settings can be filtered by using the `WHERE` clause.
For example, the following query returns the name, value, and description of the first three settings starting with 'dbms':

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
SHOW SETTINGS YIELD name, value, description
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'dbms'
RETURN name, value, description
LIMIT 3
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2m,1m,3m"]
|===
| name | value | description

| "dbms.cluster.catchup.client_inactivity_timeout"
| "10m"
| "The catchup protocol times out if the given duration elapses with no network activity. Every message received by the client from the server extends the timeout duration."

| "dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints"
| null
| "A comma-separated list of endpoints that a server should contact in order to discover other cluster members. Typically, all cluster members, including the current server, must be specified in this list. The setting configures the endpoints for Discovery service V1."

| "dbms.cluster.discovery.log_level"
| "WARN"
| "The level of middleware logging."

3+d|Rows: 3

== Listing specific settings

It is possible to specify which settings to return in the list by setting names.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
SHOW SETTINGS "server.bolt.enabled", "server.bolt.advertised_address", "server.bolt.listen_address"
----


.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2m,1m,1m,1m,3m"]
|===
| name | value | isDynamic | defaultValue | description

| "server.bolt.advertised_address"
| "localhost:7687"
| false
| ":7687"
| "Advertised address for this connector."

| "server.bolt.enabled"
| "true"
| false
| "true"
| "Enable the bolt connector."

| "server.bolt.listen_address"
| "localhost:7687"
| false
| ":7687"
| "Address the connector should bind to."
