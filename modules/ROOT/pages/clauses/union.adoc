:description: The `UNION` clause is used to combine the result of multiple queries.

[[query-union]]
= UNION

`UNION` combines the results of two or more queries into a single result set that includes all the rows that belong to any queries in the union.

The number and the names of the columns must be identical in all queries combined by using `UNION`.

To keep all the result rows, use `UNION ALL`.
Using just `UNION` (or `UNION DISTINCT`) will combine and remove duplicates from the result set.

[NOTE]
====
If any of the queries in a `UNION` contain updates, the order of queries in the `UNION` is relevant.

Any clause before the `UNION` cannot observe writes made by a clause after the `UNION`.
Any clause after `UNION` can observe all writes made by a clause before the `UNION`.

See xref::clauses/clause-composition.adoc#cypher-clause-composition-union-queries[clause composition in queries with `UNION`] for details.

[[example-graph]]
== Example graph

The following graph is used for the examples below:

image:graph_union_clause.svg[width="500", role="middle"]

To recreate the graph, run the following query against an empty Neo4j database:

[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE (johnny:Actor {name: 'Johnny Depp'}),
       (sarah:Actor {name: 'Sarah Jessica Parker'}),
       (ed:Actor&Director {name: 'Ed Wood'}),
       (edWoodMovie:Movie {title: 'Ed Wood'}),
       (johnny)-[:ACTED_IN]->(edWoodMovie),
       (sarah)-[:ACTED_IN]->(edWoodMovie)
----

[[union-combine-queries-retain-duplicates]]
== Combine two queries and retain duplicates

Combining the results from two queries is done using `UNION ALL`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Actor)
RETURN n.name AS name
UNION ALL
MATCH (n:Movie)
RETURN n.title AS name
----

The combined result is returned, including duplicates.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Johnny Depp"
| "Sarah Jessica Parker"
| "Ed Wood"
| "Ed Wood"
|Rows: 4
|===


[[union-combine-queries-remove-duplicates]]
== Combine two queries and remove duplicates

By not including `ALL` in the `UNION`, duplicates are removed from the combined result set.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Actor)
RETURN n.name AS name
UNION
MATCH (n:Movie)
RETURN n.title AS name
----

The combined result is returned, without duplicates.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Johnny Depp"
| "Sarah Jessica Parker"
| "Ed Wood"
|Rows: 3
|===

[role=label--new-5.19]
[[union-distinct]]
=== UNION DISTINCT

Removal of duplicates can also be accomplished by explicitly including `DISTINCT` in the `UNION`.
The `UNION DISTINCT` keyword was introduced as part of Cypher's xref:appendix/gql-conformance/index.adoc[], and using it is functionally the same as using simple `UNION`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Actor)
RETURN n.name AS name
UNION DISTINCT
MATCH (n:Movie)
RETURN n.title AS name
----

The combined result is returned, without duplicates.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name
| "Johnny Depp"
| "Sarah Jessica Parker"
| "Ed Wood"
|Rows: 3
|===


== Post-union processing

The `UNION` clause can be used within a xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc[`CALL` subquery] to further process the combined results before a final output is returned.
For example, the below query counts the occurrences of each combined `name` from the `UNION ALL` within the `CALL` subquery.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CALL { 
  MATCH (a:Actor)
  RETURN a.name AS name
UNION ALL
  MATCH (m:Movie)
  RETURN m.title AS name
}
RETURN name, count(*) AS count
ORDER BY count
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| name | count
| "Ed Wood" | 2
| "Johnny Depp" | 1
| "Sarah Jessica Parker" | 1
2+d|Rows: 3
|===
