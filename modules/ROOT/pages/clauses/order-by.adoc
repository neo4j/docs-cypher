[[order-introduction]]
== Introduction

`ORDER BY` relies on comparisons to sort the output, see xref:syntax/operators.adoc#cypher-ordering[Ordering and comparison of values].
You can sort on many different values, e.g. node/relationship properties, the node/relationship ids, or on most expressions.
If you do not specify what to sort on, there is a risk that the results are arbitrarily sorted and therefore it is best practice to be specific when using `ORDER BY`.

In terms of scope of variables, `ORDER BY` follows special rules, depending on if the projecting `RETURN` or `WITH` clause is either aggregating or `DISTINCT`.
If it is an aggregating or `DISTINCT` projection, only the variables available in the projection are available.
If the projection does not alter the output cardinality (which aggregation and `DISTINCT` do), variables available from before the projecting clause are also available.
When the projection clause shadows already existing variables, only the new variables are available.

Lastly, it is not allowed to use aggregating expressions in the `ORDER BY` sub-clause if they are not also listed in the projecting clause.
This last rule is to make sure that `ORDER BY` does not change the results, only the order of them.

The performance of Cypher queries using `ORDER BY` on node properties can be influenced by the existence and use of an index for finding the nodes.
If the index can provide the nodes in the order requested in the query, Cypher can avoid the use of an expensive `Sort` operation.
Read more about this capability in xref:query-tuning/indexes.adoc[The use of indexes].

Strings that contain special characters can have inconsistent or non-deterministic ordering in Neo4j.

[[order-nodes-by-multiple-properties]]
== Order nodes by multiple properties

You can order by multiple properties by stating each variable in the `ORDER BY` clause.
Cypher will sort the result by the first variable listed, and for equals values, go to the next property in the `ORDER BY` clause, and so on.


.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n.name, n.age
ORDER BY n.age, n.name
----

This returns the nodes, sorted first by their age, and then by their name.

[[order-nodes-by-id]]
== Order nodes by id

`ORDER BY` is used to sort the output.


.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n.name, n.age
ORDER BY id(n)
----

The nodes are returned, sorted by their internal id.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that Neo4j reuses its internal ids when nodes and relationships are deleted.
This means that applications using, and relying on, internal Neo4j ids, are brittle or at risk of making mistakes.
It is therefore recommended to use application-generated ids instead.

[[order-nodes-by-expression]]
== Order nodes by expression

`ORDER BY` is used to sort the output.

[[order-nodes-in-descending-order]]
== Order nodes in descending order

By adding `DESC[ENDING]` after the variable to sort on, the sort will be done in reverse order.


.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n.name, n.age
ORDER BY n.name DESC
----

The example returns the nodes, sorted by their name in reverse order.

[[order-null]]
== Ordering `null`

When sorting the result set, `null` will always come at the end of the result set for ascending sorting, and first when doing descending sort.


.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n.length, n.name, n.age
ORDER BY n.length
----

The nodes are returned sorted by the length property, with a node without that property last.
