:description: The `DELETE` clause is used to delete nodes, relationships or paths.

[[query-delete]]
= DELETE

The `DELETE` clause is used to delete nodes, relationships or paths.

For removing properties and labels, see the xref::clauses/remove.adoc[REMOVE] clause.

It is not possible to delete nodes with relationships connected to them without also deleting the relationships. 
This can be done by either explicitly deleting specific relationships, or by using the `DETACH DELETE` clause. 

== Example graph 

The following graph is used for the examples below. 
It shows four actors, three of whom `ACTED_IN` the `Movie` `The Matrix` (`Keanu Reeves`, `Carrie-Anne Moss`, and `Laurence Fishburne`), and one actor who did not act in it (`Tom Hanks`).

To recreate the graph, run the following query in an empty Neo4j database: 

[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE
  (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reever'}),
  (laurence:Person {name: 'Laurence Fishburne'}),
  (carrie:Person {name: 'Carrie-Anne Moss'}),
  (tom:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}),
  (theMatrix:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'}),
  (keanu)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theMatrix),
  (laurence)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theMatrix),
  (carrie)-[:ACTED_IN]->(theMatrix)
----

[[delete-single-node]]
== Delete single node

To delete a single node, use the `DELETE` clause:

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
DELETE n
----

This deletes the `Person` node `Tom Hanks`.
This query is only possible to run on nodes without any relationships connected to them. 

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="footer",cols="1*<m"]
----
Deleted 1 node
----

[role=label--new-5.14]
[[delete-nodetach]]
=== NODETACH keyword

It is also possible to delete the single node using the `NODETACH DELETE` clause.
Using the `NODETACH` keyword explicitly defines that relationships will not be detached and deleted from a node.
The `NODETACH` keyword is a mirror of the already existing keyword xref:clauses/delete.adoc#delete-a-node-with-all-its-relationships[DETACH].
Including it is functionally the same as using simple `DELETE`.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
NODETACH DELETE n
----

This also deletes the `Person` node `Tom Hanks`.

[[delete-relationships-only]]
== Delete relationships only

It is possible to delete a relationship while leaving the node(s) connected to that relationship otherwise unaffected.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Laurence Fishburne'})-[r:ACTED_IN]->()
DELETE r
----

This deletes all outgoing `ACTED_IN` relationships from the `Person` node `Laurence Fishburne`, without deleting the node. 

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="footer",cols="1*<m"]
----
Deleted 1 relationship
----


[[delete-a-node-with-all-its-relationships]]
== Delete a node with all its relationships

To delete nodes and any relationships connected them, use the `DETACH DELETE` clause.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Carrie-Anne Moss'})
DETACH DELETE n
----

This deletes the `Person` node `Carrie-Anne Moss` and all relationships connected to it. 

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="footer",cols="1*<m"]
----
Deleted 1 node, deleted 1 relationship
----

[NOTE]
====
The `DETACH DELETE` clause may not be permitted to users with restricted security privileges. 
For more information, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/authentication-authorization/access-control#detach-delete-restricted-user[Operations Manual -> Fine-grained access control].

[[delete-all-nodes-and-relationships]]
== Delete all nodes and relationships

It is possible to delete all nodes and relationships in a graph. 

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n)
DETACH DELETE n
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="footer",cols="1*<m"]
----
Deleted 3 nodes, deleted 1 relationship
----

[TIP]
====
`DETACH DELETE` is not suitable for deleting large amounts of data, but is useful when experimenting with small example datasets.
To delete large amounts of data, instead use xref::subqueries/subqueries-in-transactions.adoc#delete-with-call-in-transactions[CALL subqueries in transactions].
