[[header-reading-clauses]]
**Reading clauses**

These comprise clauses that read data from the database.

The flow of data within a Cypher query is an unordered sequence of maps with key-value pairs -- a set of possible bindings between the variables in the query and values derived from the database.
This set is refined and augmented by subsequent parts of the query.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

m|xref:clauses/match.adoc[MATCH]
|Specify the patterns to search for in the database.

m|xref:clauses/optional-match.adoc[OPTIONAL MATCH]
|Specify the patterns to search for in the database while using `nulls` for missing parts of the pattern.

|===


[[header-projecting-clauses]]
**Projecting clauses**

These comprise clauses that define which expressions to return in the result set.
The returned expressions may all be aliased using `AS`.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

//RETURN ... [AS]
m|xref:clauses/return.adoc[RETURN +++...+++ [AS\]]
|Defines what to include in the query result set.

//WITH ... [AS]
m|xref:clauses/with.adoc[WITH +++...+++ [AS\]]
|Allows query parts to be chained together, piping the results from one to be used as starting points or criteria in the next.

//UNWIND ... [AS]
m|xref:clauses/unwind.adoc[UNWIND +++...+++ [AS\]]
|Expands a list into a sequence of rows.

|===


[[header-reading-sub-clauses]]
**Reading sub-clauses**

These comprise sub-clauses that must operate as part of reading clauses.

[options="header"]
|===
|Sub-clause | Description

m|xref:clauses/where.adoc[WHERE]
|Adds constraints to the patterns in a `MATCH` or `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause or filters the results of a `WITH` clause.

//WHERE EXISTS { ... }
m|xref:clauses/where.adoc#existential-subqueries[WHERE EXISTS +++{ ... }+++]
|An existential sub-query used to filter the results of a `MATCH`, `OPTIONAL MATCH` or `WITH` clause.

//ORDER BY [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]
m|xref:clauses/order-by.adoc[ORDER BY &#91;ASC&#91;ENDING&#93; &#124; DESC&#91;ENDING&#93;&#93;]
|A sub-clause following `RETURN` or `WITH`, specifying that the output should be sorted in either ascending (the default) or descending order.

m|xref:clauses/skip.adoc[SKIP]
|Defines from which row to start including the rows in the output.

m|xref:clauses/limit.adoc[LIMIT]
|Constrains the number of rows in the output.

|===


[[header-reading-hints]]
**Reading hints**

These comprise clauses used to specify planner hints when tuning a query.
More details regarding the usage of these -- and query tuning in general -- can be found in xref:query-tuning/using.adoc[Planner hints and the USING keyword].

[options="header"]
|===
|Hint |Description

m|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-index-hint[USING INDEX]
|Index hints are used to specify which index, if any, the planner should use as a starting point.

m|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-index-hint[USING INDEX SEEK]
|Index seek hint instructs the planner to use an index seek for this clause.

m|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-scan-hint[USING SCAN]
|Scan hints are used to force the planner to do a label scan (followed by a filtering operation) instead of using an index.

m|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-join-hint[USING JOIN]
|Join hints are used to enforce a join operation at specified points.

|===


[[header-writing-clauses]]
**Writing clauses**

These comprise clauses that write the data to the database.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

m|xref:clauses/create.adoc[CREATE]
|Create nodes and relationships.

m|xref:clauses/delete.adoc[DELETE]
a|
Delete nodes, relationships or paths.
Any node to be deleted must also have all associated relationships explicitly deleted.

m|xref:clauses/delete.adoc[DETACH DELETE]
a|
Delete a node or set of nodes.
All associated relationships will automatically be deleted.

m|xref:clauses/set.adoc[SET]
|Update labels on nodes and properties on nodes and relationships.

m|xref:clauses/remove.adoc[REMOVE]
|Remove properties and labels from nodes and relationships.

m|xref:clauses/foreach.adoc[FOREACH]
|Update data within a list, whether components of a path, or the result of aggregation.

m|--- xref:clauses/merge.adoc#query-merge-on-create-on-match[ON CREATE]
|Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, this write sub-clause specifies the actions to take if the pattern needs to be created.

m|--- xref:clauses/merge.adoc#query-merge-on-create-on-match[ON MATCH]
|Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, this write sub-clause specifies the actions to take if the pattern already exists.

//CALL ... [YIELD ... ]
m|xref:clauses/call.adoc[CALL +++...+++ &#91;YIELD +++...+++ &#93;]
|Invokes a procedure deployed in the database and return any results.

|Use when importing data from CSV files.

|===


[[header-administration-clauses]]
**Administration clauses**

These comprise clauses used to manage databases, schema and security; further details can found in xref:administration/index.adoc[].
