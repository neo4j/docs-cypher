[[header-reading-clauses]]
**Reading clauses**

These comprise clauses that read data from the database.

The flow of data within a Cypher query is an unordered sequence of maps with key-value pairs -- a set of possible bindings between the variables in the query and values derived from the database.
This set is refined and augmented by subsequent parts of the query.

[[header-projecting-clauses]]
**Projecting clauses**

These comprise clauses that define which expressions to return in the result set.
The returned expressions may all be aliased using `AS`.

|xref:clauses/return.adoc[RETURN ... [AS\]]     | Defines what to include in the query result set.
|xref:clauses/with.adoc[WITH ... [AS\]]         | Allows query parts to be chained together, piping the results from one to be used as starting points or criteria in the next.
|xref:clauses/unwind.adoc[UNWIND ... [AS\]]                    | Expands a list into a sequence of rows.
|===


[[header-reading-sub-clauses]]

These comprise sub-clauses that must operate as part of reading clauses.

[options="header"]
|===
|Sub-clause                                         | Description
|xref:clauses/where.adoc[WHERE]                          | Adds constraints to the patterns in a `MATCH` or `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause or filters the results of a `WITH` clause.
|xref:clauses/order-by.adoc[ORDER BY [ASC[ENDING\] \| DESC[ENDING\]\]]                       | A sub-clause following `RETURN` or `WITH`, specifying that the output should be sorted in either ascending (the default) or descending order.
|xref:clauses/skip.adoc[SKIP]                            | Defines from which row to start including the rows in the output.

[[header-reading-hints]]
**Reading hints**

These comprise clauses used to specify planner hints when tuning a query.
More details regarding the usage of these -- and query tuning in general -- can be found in xref:query-tuning/using.adoc[Planner hints and the USING keyword].

[options="header"]
|===
|Hint                                       | Description
|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-index-hint[USING INDEX]       | Index hints are used to specify which index, if any, the planner should use as a starting point.
|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-index-hint[USING INDEX SEEK]  | Index seek hint instructs the planner to use an index seek for this clause.
|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-scan-hint[USING SCAN]         | Scan hints are used to force the planner to do a label scan (followed by a filtering operation) instead of using an index.
|xref:query-tuning/using.adoc#query-using-join-hint[USING JOIN]         | Join hints are used to enforce a join operation at specified points.
|===


[[header-writing-clauses]]
**Writing clauses**

These comprise clauses that write the data to the database.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause                                     |   Description
|xref:clauses/create.adoc[CREATE]                    |   Create nodes and relationships.
|xref:clauses/delete.adoc[DELETE]                    |   Delete nodes, relationships or paths. Any node to be deleted must also have all associated relationships explicitly deleted.
|xref:clauses/delete.adoc[DETACH DELETE]             |   Delete a node or set of nodes. All associated relationships will automatically be deleted.
|xref:clauses/set.adoc[SET]                          |   Update labels on nodes and properties on nodes and relationships.
|xref:clauses/remove.adoc[REMOVE]                    |   Remove properties and labels from nodes and relationships.
|xref:clauses/foreach.adoc[FOREACH]                  |   Update data within a list, whether components of a path, or the result of aggregation.
|===


[[header-reading-writing-clauses]]

|xref:clauses/merge.adoc[MERGE]                              |   Ensures that a pattern exists in the graph. Either the pattern already exists, or it needs to be created.
|--- xref:clauses/merge.adoc#query-merge-on-create-on-match[ON CREATE]   | Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, this write sub-clause specifies the actions to take if the pattern needs to be created.
|--- xref:clauses/merge.adoc#query-merge-on-create-on-match[ON MATCH]    | Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, this write sub-clause specifies the actions to take if the pattern already exists.

|===


[[header-schema-clauses]]
**Schema clauses**

These comprise clauses used to manage the schema; further details can found in xref:schema/index.adoc[].

[role=deprecated]
[[query-start]]
== START

[abstract]
Find starting points through explicit indexes.

The `START` clause was removed in Cypher 3.2, and the recommendation is to use `MATCH` instead (see xref:clauses/match.adoc[MATCH]).
However, if the use of explicit indexes is required, a series of xref:schema/indexes.adoc#explicit-indexes-procedures[built-in procedures] allows these to be managed and used.
These procedures offer the same functionality as the `START` clause.
In addition, queries using these procedures may exhibit superior execution performance over queries using `START` owing to the use of the xref:query-tuning/index.adoc#cypher-planner[cost planner] and newer Cypher 3.2 compiler.

[IMPORTANT]
Using the `START` clause explicitly in a query will cause the query to fall back to using Cypher 3.1.
