:description: The `FINISH` clause defines a query to have no result.
:page-role: new-5.19
[[query-finish]]
= FINISH

A query ending in `FINISH` — instead of `RETURN` — has no result but executes all its side effects.
It was introduced as part of Cypher's xref:appendix/gql-conformance/index.adoc[].

The following read query successfully executes but has no results:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
FINISH
----

The following query has no result but creates one node with the label `Person`:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person)
FINISH
----

It is equivalent to the following query:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person)
----
