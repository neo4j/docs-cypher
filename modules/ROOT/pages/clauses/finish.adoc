:description: The `FINISH` clause defines a query to have no result.

[[query-finish]]
= FINISH

A query ending in `FINISH` — instead of `RETURN` — have no result but executes all its side effects.

The reading query

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
FINISH
----

is allowed but has no result.

The updating query

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person)
FINISH
----

is equivalent to

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person)
----

in that it has no result but create one node with label `Person`.
