[[match-introduction]]
== Introduction

The `MATCH` clause allows you to specify the patterns Neo4j will search for in the database.
This is the primary way of getting data into the current set of bindings.
For more information about how `MATCH` is used to find patterns (including xref:patterns/concepts.adoc#quantified-path-patterns[quantified path patterns], xref:patterns/concepts.adoc#quantified-relationships[quantified relationships], and xref:patterns/concepts.adoc#shortest-path[shortest path]), see the section on xref::patterns/index.adoc[Patterns].

`MATCH` is often coupled to a `WHERE` part which adds restrictions, or predicates, to the `MATCH` patterns, making them more specific.
The predicates are part of the pattern description, and should not be considered a filter applied only after the matching is done.
_This means that `WHERE` should always be put together with the `MATCH` clause it belongs to._

`MATCH` can occur at the beginning of the query or later, possibly after a `WITH`.
If it is the first clause, nothing will have been bound yet, and Neo4j will design a search to find the results matching the clause and any associated predicates specified in any `WHERE` part.
This could involve a scan of the database, a search for nodes having a certain label, or a search of an index to find starting points for the pattern matching.
Nodes and relationships found by this search are available as _bound pattern elements,_ and can be used for pattern matching of paths.
They can also be used in any further `MATCH` clauses, where Neo4j will use the known elements, and from there find further unknown elements.

Cypher is declarative, and so usually the query itself does not specify the algorithm to use to perform the search.
Neo4j will automatically work out the best approach to finding start nodes and matching patterns.
Predicates in `WHERE` parts can be evaluated before pattern matching, during pattern matching, or after finding matches.
However, there are cases where you can influence the decisions taken by the query compiler.
Read more about indexes in xref::indexes-for-search-performance.adoc[], and more about specifying hints to force Neo4j to solve a query in a specific way in xref::query-tuning/using.adoc[Planner hints and the USING keyword].


[[match-example-graph]]
== Example graph

The following graph is used for the examples below:

image::graph_match_clause.svg[width="600",role="middle"]

To recreate the graph, run the following query against an empty Neo4j database:

[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE
  (charlie:Person {name: 'Charlie Sheen'}),
  (martin:Person {name: 'Martin Sheen'}),
  (michael:Person {name: 'Michael Douglas'}),
  (oliver:Person {name: 'Oliver Stone'}),
  (rob:Person {name: 'Rob Reiner'}),
  (wallStreet:Movie {title: 'Wall Street'}),
  (charlie)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Bud Fox'}]->(wallStreet),
  (martin)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Carl Fox'}]->(wallStreet),
  (michael)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Gordon Gekko'}]->(wallStreet),
  (oliver)-[:DIRECTED]->(wallStreet),

[[basic-node-finding]]
== Basic node finding

[[get-all-nodes]]
=== Get all nodes

By specifying a pattern with a single node and no labels, all nodes in the graph will be returned.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n
----

Returns all the nodes in the database.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| n
| (:Person {"name":"Charlie Sheen"})
| (:Person {"name":"Martin Sheen"})
| (:Person {"name":"Michael Douglas"})
| (:Person {"name":"Oliver Stone"})

| (:Movie {"title":"Wall Street"})
| (:Movie {"title":"The American President"})
|Rows: 7
|===


[[get-all-nodes-with-label]]
=== Get all nodes with a label

Find all nodes with a specific label:

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title
----

Returns all the nodes with the `Movie` label in the database.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| movie.title
| "Wall Street"
| "The American President"
|Rows: 2
|===


[[related-nodes]]
=== Related nodes

The symbol `--` means _related to,_ without regard to type or direction of the relationship.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (director {name: 'Oliver Stone'})--(movie)
RETURN movie.title
----

Returns all the movies directed by `Oliver Stone`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| movie.title
| "Wall Street"
|Rows: 1
|===


[[match-with-labels]]
=== Match with labels

To constrain a pattern with labels on nodes, add the labels to the nodes in the pattern.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Oliver Stone'})--(movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title
----

Returns any nodes with the `Movie` label connected to `Oliver Stone`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| movie.title
| "Wall Street"
|Rows: 1
|===


[[label-expression-match-or-expression]]
=== Match with a label expression for the node labels

A match with an `OR` expression for the node label returns the nodes that contains both the specified labels.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Movie|Person)
RETURN n.name AS name, n.title AS title
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]

[[relationship-basics]]
== Relationship basics

[[outgoing-relationships]]
=== Outgoing relationships

When the direction of a relationship is of interest, it is shown by using `-->` or `<--`.
For example:

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Oliver Stone'})-->(movie)
RETURN movie.title
----

Returns any nodes connected by an outgoing relationship to the `Person` node with the `name` property set to `Oliver Stone`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| movie.title
| "Wall Street"
|Rows: 1
|===


[[directed-rels-and-variable]]
=== Relationship variables

It is possible to introduce a variable to a pattern, either for filtering on relationship properties or to return a relationship.
For example:

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Oliver Stone'})-[r]->(movie)
RETURN type(r)
----

Returns the type of each outgoing relationship from `Oliver Stone`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| type(r)
| "DIRECTED"
|Rows: 1
|===

=== Match on an undirected relationship

When a pattern contains a bound relationship, and that relationship pattern does not specify direction, Cypher will try to match the relationship in both directions.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (a)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Bud Fox'}]-(b)
RETURN a, b
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| a | b

| (:Movie {"title":"Wall Street"})
| (:Person {"name":"Charlie Sheen"})

| (:Person {"name":"Charlie Sheen"})
| (:Movie {"title":"Wall Street"})

2+|Rows: 2
|===


[[match-on-rel-type]]
=== Match on relationship type

When the relationship type to match on is known, it is possible to specify it by using a colon (`:`) before the relationship type.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (wallstreet:Movie {title: 'Wall Street'})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(actor)
RETURN actor.name
----

Returns all actors who `ACTED_IN` the movie `Wall Street`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| actor.name
| "Michael Douglas"
| "Martin Sheen"
| "Charlie Sheen"
|Rows: 3
|===

Read more about xref:/syntax/expressions.adoc#relationship-type-expressions[relationship type expressions].

[[match-on-multiple-rel-types]]
=== Match on multiple relationship types

It is possible to match on multiple relationship types by using the pipe symbol (`|`).
For example:

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (wallstreet {title: 'Wall Street'})<-[:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED]-(person)
RETURN person.name
----

Returns nodes with an `ACTED_IN` or `DIRECTED` relationship to the movie `Wall Street`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| person.name
| "Oliver Stone"
| "Michael Douglas"
| "Martin Sheen"
| "Charlie Sheen"
|Rows: 4
|===


[[match-on-rel-type-use-variable]]
=== Match on relationship type and use a variable

Variables and specific relationship types can be included in the same pattern.
For example:

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (wallstreet {title: 'Wall Street'})<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(actor)
RETURN r.role
----

Returns the `ACTED_IN` roles for the movie `Wall Street`.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| r.role
| "Gordon Gekko"
| "Carl Fox"
| "Bud Fox"
|Rows: 3
|===


[[relationships-in-depth]]
== Relationships in depth

[NOTE]
====
Relationships will only be matched once inside a single pattern.
Read more about this in the section on xref::patterns/reference.adoc#graph-patterns-rules-relationship-uniqueness[relationship uniqueness].
====

[[rel-types-with-uncommon-chars]]
=== Relationship types with uncommon characters

Databases occasionally contain relationship types including non-alphanumerical characters, or with spaces in them.
These are created using backticks (```).

For example, the following query creates a relationship which contains a space (`OLD FRIENDS`) between `Martin Sheen` and `Rob Reiner`.

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH
  (martin:Person {name: 'Martin Sheen'}),
  (rob:Person {name: 'Rob Reiner'})
CREATE (rob)-[:`OLD FRIENDS`]->(martin)
----

This leads to the following graph:

image::graph_match_clause_backtick.svg[width="600", role="middle"]

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (n {name: 'Rob Reiner'})-[r:`OLD FRIENDS`]->()
RETURN type(r)
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| type(r)
| "OLD FRIENDS"
|Rows: 1
|===


[[multiple-rels]]
=== Multiple relationships

Relationships can be expressed by using multiple statements in the form of `()--()`, or they can be strung together.
For example:

.Query
[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (charlie {name: 'Charlie Sheen'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(director)
RETURN movie.title, director.name
----

Returns the movie in which `Charlie Sheen` acted and its director.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| movie.title | director.name
| "Wall Street" | "Oliver Stone"
2+|Rows: 1
|===
