This section explains the `SHOW PROCEDURES` command.
--

Listing the available procedures can be done with `SHOW PROCEDURES`.

[NOTE]
====
The command `SHOW PROCEDURES` returns only the default output. For a full output use the optional `YIELD` command.
Full output: `SHOW PROCEDURES YIELD *`.
====

This command will produce a table with the following columns:

.List procedures output
[options="header", cols="4,6,2"]
|===
| Column | Description | Type

m| name
a| The name of the procedure. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| description
a| The procedure description. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| mode
a| The procedure mode, for example `READ` or `WRITE`. label:default-output[]
m| STRING

m| worksOnSystem
a| Whether the procedure can be run on the `system` database or not. label:default-output[]
m| BOOLEAN

m| signature
a| The signature of the procedure.
m| STRING

m| argumentDescription
a| List of the arguments for the procedure, as map of strings and booleans with `name`, `type`, `default`, `isDeprecated`, and `description`.
m| LIST<MAP>

m| returnDescription
a| List of the returned values for the procedure, as map of strings and booleans with `name`, `type`, `isDeprecated`, and `description`.
m| LIST<MAP>

m| admin
a| `true` if this procedure is an admin procedure.
m| BOOLEAN

m| rolesExecution
a|
List of roles permitted to execute this procedure.
Is `null` without the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-role-management[`SHOW ROLE`] privilege.
m| LIST<STRING>

m| rolesBoostedExecution
a|
List of roles permitted to use boosted mode when executing this procedure.
Is `null` without the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-role-management[`SHOW ROLE`] privilege.
m| LIST<STRING>

m| isDeprecated
a| Whether the procedure is deprecated.
label:new[Introduced in 5.9]
m| BOOLEAN

m| option
a| Map of extra output, e.g. if the procedure is deprecated.
m| MAP

|===

The deprecation information for procedures is returned both in the `isDeprecated` and `option` columns.

== Syntax

[NOTE]
====
More details about the syntax descriptions can be found xref:administration/index.adoc#administration-syntax[here].
====

List all procedures::

[source, syntax, role="noheader", indent=0]
----
SHOW PROCEDURE[S]
[YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
[WHERE expression]
[RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

[NOTE]
====
When using the `RETURN` clause, the `YIELD` clause is mandatory and must not be omitted.
====

List procedures that the current user can execute::

[source, syntax, role="noheader", indent=0]
----
SHOW PROCEDURE[S] EXECUTABLE [BY CURRENT USER]
[YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
[WHERE expression]
[RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

[NOTE]
====
When using the `RETURN` clause, the `YIELD` clause is mandatory and must not be omitted.
====

List procedures that the specified user can execute::

[source, syntax, role="noheader", indent=0]
----
SHOW PROCEDURE[S] EXECUTABLE BY username
[YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
[WHERE expression]
[RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

Requires the privilege xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-user-management[`SHOW USER`].
This command cannot be used for LDAP users.

[NOTE]
====
When using the `RETURN` clause, the `YIELD` clause is mandatory and must not be omitted.
====


== Listing all procedures

To list all available procedures with the default output columns, the `SHOW PROCEDURES` command can be used.
If all columns are required, use `SHOW PROCEDURES YIELD *`.

The above table only displays the first 15 results of the query.
For a full list of all built-in procedures in Neo4j, visit the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/reference/procedures#/#_list_of_procedures[Operations Manual -> List of procedures].

== Listing procedures with filtering on output columns

The listed procedures can be filtered in multiple ways, one way is to use the `WHERE` clause.
For example, returning the names of all `admin` procedures:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-result-skip]
----
SHOW PROCEDURES YIELD name, admin
WHERE admin
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| name | admin

| "db.clearQueryCaches" | true
| "db.listLocks" | true
| "db.prepareForReplanning" | true
| "db.stats.clear" | true
| "db.stats.collect" | true
| "db.stats.retrieve" | true
| "db.stats.retrieveAllAnonymized" | true
| "db.stats.status" | true
| "db.stats.stop" | true
| "dbms.checkConfigValue" | true
| "dbms.cluster.checkConnectivity" | true
| "dbms.cluster.cordonServer" | true
| "dbms.cluster.readReplicaToggle" | true
| "dbms.cluster.uncordonServer" | true
| "dbms.listConfig" | true

2+d|Rows: 15
|===

The above table only displays the first 15 results of the query.
For a full list of all procedures which require `admin` privileges in Neo4j, visit the {neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/reference/procedures#/#_list_of_procedures[Operations Manual -> List of procedures].

== Listing procedures with other filtering

The listed procedures can also be filtered by whether a user can execute them.
This filtering is only available through the `EXECUTABLE` clause and not through the `WHERE` clause.
This is due to using the user's privileges instead of filtering on the available output columns.

There are two options for using the `EXECUTABLE` clause.
The first option is to filter for the current user:

.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-result-skip]
----
SHOW PROCEDURES EXECUTABLE BY CURRENT USER YIELD *
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2m,2m,1m,1m,1m"]

The above table only displays the first 15 results of the query.
Note that the two `roles` columns are empty due to missing the xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-role-management[`SHOW ROLE`] privilege.
Also note that the following columns are not present in the table: 

* `mode`
* `worksOnSystem`
* `signature`
* `argumentDescription`
* `returnDescription`
* `admin`
* `isDeprecated`
* `options`

The second option for using the `EXECUTABLE` clause is to filter the list to only contain procedures executable by a specific user.
The below example shows the procedures available to the user `jake`, who has been granted the `EXECUTE PROCEDURE dbms.*` privilege by the `admin` of the database.
(More information about `DBMS EXECUTE` privilege administration can be found xref::administration/access-control/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-execute[here]).
